1
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,458
Peter.

2
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:43,064
Your momma wants to speak with you.

3
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,310
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

4
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:26,412
Why have you been fighting with
the other boys again, baby?

5
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,156
Peter?

6
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,850
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

7
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,061
Smushed it with a stick.

8
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:40,695
You're so like your daddy.

9
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,397
You even look like him.

10
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,727
And he was an angel.

11
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:50,442
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

12
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:52,942
You got a present there
for Peter, don't you?

13
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,438
Of course.

14
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,710
There.

15
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,218
I've got you covered, Pete.

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,491
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

17
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,593
Your grandpa

18
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,736
is gonna take such good care of you.

19
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:22,102
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

20
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:26,944
Take my hand.

21
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,178
Peter.

22
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:34,587
Pete, come on.

23
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,882
Take my hand.

24
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,863
Mom?

25
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,932
No! No! No! No!

26
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:48,367
Mom! No!

27
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,002
- Come with me.
- No!

28
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:52,331
No!

29
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,206
You've got to stay here. Please.

30
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:55,773
No...

31
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,608
Okay?

32
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:19,224
No.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,509
Mom!

34
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:28,807
Drop it!

35
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,635
Hey.

36
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,912
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

37
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,446
No problem at all.

38
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:38,317
How do you know about this?

39
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,052
I don't even know what that is.

40
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,788
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

41
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:45,224
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

42
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,592
This is just an outfit, man.

43
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,261
- Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.
- What is your name?

44
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,630
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

45
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,131
- Move!
- Why?

46
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,534
Ronan may have questions for you.

47
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:59,095
Hey, you know what? There's another
name you might know me by.

48
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:02,808
Star-Lord.

49
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:06,937
- Who?
- Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

50
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:10,239
- Guys?
- Move!

51
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,343
Forget this.

52
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,662
Peter?

53
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,601
What happened?

54
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:13,029
Hey...

55
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:15,194
I...

56
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,542
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

57
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:20,576
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

58
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:47,205
Scattered riots broke out
across the Kree Empire today

59
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:50,809
protesting the recent peace
treaty signed by the Kree Emperor

60
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:53,878
and Xandar's Nova Prime.

61
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,747
Peter, you have call.

62
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:00,243
- No, wait, don't!
- Quill?

63
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,588
Hey, Yondu.

64
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,757
I'm here on Morag.

65
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,058
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.

66
00:12:07,158 --> 00:12:09,327
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

67
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:10,695
Well, where are you at now, boy?

68
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,365
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

69
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,967
- I slaved putting this deal together.
- Slaved?

70
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,102
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

71
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:18,236
And now you're gonna rip me off!

72
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:21,840
We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.

73
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,676
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

74
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,645
- When I picked you up on Terra...
- "Picked me up."

75
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,681
- ...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
- Yeah?

76
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,816
They ain't never tasted
any Terran before.

77
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,151
I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!

78
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,945
I will find you, I will...

79
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:38,590
Put a bounty on him! Forty K.

80
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,325
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

81
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:41,860
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

82
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,299
I told you when you picked that kid up,
you should have delivered him

83
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,065
like we was hired to do!
He was cargo!

84
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:51,903
- You have always been soft on him.
- You're the only one I'm being soft on!

85
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:54,773
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

86
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,341
As soon as we get him back here,

87
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:00,178
I'm gonna kill him myself.

88
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:02,075
What we do need to worry about,

89
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,881
is who else out there wants that Orb!

90
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,534
They call me "terrorist,"

91
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,801
"radical," "zealot,"

92
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:35,805
because I obey the ancient
laws of my people, the Kree,

93
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:39,651
and punish those who do not.

94
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,888
Because I do not forgive your people

95
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,979
for taking the life of my father,

96
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:50,027
and his father,
and his father before him.

97
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:55,767
A thousand years of war between
us will not be forgotten!

98
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:59,165
You can't do this! Our government
signed a peace treaty.

99
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,601
My government knows no shame.

100
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:06,539
You Xandarians and your
culture are a disease.

101
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,513
You

102
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,916
will never rule Xandar.

103
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,505
No.

104
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,544
I will cure it!

105
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:29,401
Ronan,

106
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,369
Korath has returned.

107
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:34,673
Master, he is a thief,

108
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,841
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

109
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,477
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

110
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:42,380
to retrieve the Orb for
an intermediary known

111
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,015
as The Broker.

112
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:47,552
I promised Thanos I would
retrieve the Orb for him.

113
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:50,712
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

114
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:55,023
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

115
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:56,494
It will be my honor.

116
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:58,083
It will be your doom.

117
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:01,433
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

118
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,234
without his prize.

119
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,301
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

120
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:06,538
Just like you.

121
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:07,973
But I know Xandar.

122
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,741
Ronan has already decreed that I...

123
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,308
Do not speak for me.

124
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:15,812
You will not fail.

125
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,140
Have I ever?

126
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,602
Xandarians.

127
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:39,904
What a bunch of losers.

128
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:44,576
All of them in a big hurry to
get from something stupid,

129
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,911
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

130
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:47,979
Look at this guy!

131
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,648
Can you believe they call us criminals,

132
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,083
when he's assaulting
us with that haircut?

133
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:54,953
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

134
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:58,657
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

135
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,157
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

136
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:05,522
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

137
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,666
Right, Groot?

138
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:08,833
Groot?

139
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,835
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

140
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,471
That's disgusting!

141
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:15,507
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

142
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,199
Why are you lying?

143
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:22,347
Looks like we got one.

144
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:26,906
Okay, humie, how bad does
someone wanna find you?

145
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,583
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

146
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:47,866
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

147
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,240
The Orb.

148
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,845
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

149
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:55,680
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

150
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,815
And told me to tell you,

151
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,610
that you got the best
eyebrows in the business.

152
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:02,841
What is it?

153
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:06,491
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

154
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:08,626
Yeah, well, I almost
died getting it for you.

155
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:12,127
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

156
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,060
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

157
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,969
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

158
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,070
I truly am.

159
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,333
But I want no part of this
transaction if Ronan is involved.

160
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,076
Who's Ronan?

161
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:28,413
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

162
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:32,851
who will not rest until
Xandarian culture, my culture,

163
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,660
- is wiped from existence!
- Come on.

164
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:37,122
He's someone whose bad
side I'd rather not be on.

165
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,752
- What? What about my bad side?
- Farewell, Mr. Quill.

166
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,460
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

167
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,592
What happened?

168
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:57,003
This guy just backed out of a deal on me.
If there's one thing I hate,

169
00:17:57,104 --> 00:18:00,835
it's a man without integrity.
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

170
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:04,182
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

171
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,841
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

172
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:09,655
People say it about me, all the time,

173
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,422
but it's not something I
would ever say about myself.

174
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:32,134
This wasn't the plan.

175
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,414
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

176
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:38,817
No! Not her, him!

177
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,816
Learn genders, man.

178
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:44,347
Biting? That's not fair!

179
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,486
Take it easy!

180
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,457
Fool. You should have learned.

181
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,820
I don't learn. One of my issues.

182
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,160
What the...

183
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,533
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

184
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,179
You gotta be kidding me.

185
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,144
Hey!

186
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,834
I live for the simple things.

187
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,595
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

188
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:12,542
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

189
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,680
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

190
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,747
Quit whining.

191
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:29,353
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

192
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,062
Crap.

193
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,597
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

194
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:34,499
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

195
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,768
...for endangerment to life and
the destruction of property.

196
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,038
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

197
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,408
- Star-Lord.
- Sorry. "Lord."

198
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:47,111
I picked this guy up a while back for
petty theft. He's got a code name.

199
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:48,246
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

200
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,214
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

201
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:52,016
Just relax, pal.

202
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:54,675
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

203
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,777
Fascists.

204
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:14,238
Ronan is destroying Xandarian
outposts throughout the galaxy.

205
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:18,206
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

206
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,179
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime.
What more do you want?

207
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,616
At least a statement from the Kree Empire
saying that they condemn his actions.

208
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:29,721
He is slaughtering children.
Families.

209
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:34,681
That is your business. Now,
I have other matters to attend to.

210
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,127
Prick.

211
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,365
Well, some good news.

212
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,901
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

213
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:48,272
Gamora. Surgically modified and
trained as a living weapon.

214
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:51,209
The adopted daughter of
the Mad Titan, Thanos.

215
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,479
Recently, Thanos lent her and
her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

216
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,849
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

217
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:02,320
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

218
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,788
The result of illegal genetic

219
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:06,991
and cybernetic experiments
on a lower life form.

220
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:09,160
What the hell?

221
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,828
They call it "Groot."

222
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:13,398
A humanoid plant that's
been travelling recently

223
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,126
as 89P13's personal
houseplantlmuscle.

224
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,972
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

225
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:24,142
Raised from youth by a band of
mercenaries called the Ravagers,

226
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,077
led by Yondu Udonta.

227
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:27,678
I'm sorry.

228
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:30,748
I didn't know how this machine worked.

229
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:33,351
What a bunch of a-holes.

230
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:36,385
Transport all four to the Kyln.

231
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:42,193
I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

232
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:45,863
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

233
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:49,834
But, hey, that's not my problem.
I ain't gonna be here long.

234
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:53,404
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

235
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:56,074
You're lucky the broad showed up,
because otherwise, me and Groot

236
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,009
would be collecting
that bounty right now,

237
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:01,145
and you'd be getting drawn and
quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.

238
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:03,381
I've had a lot of folks try
to kill me over the years.

239
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:06,284
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

240
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,452
Hold.

241
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,454
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

242
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,855
It's what you are, stupid.

243
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:13,991
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

244
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:16,661
So, this Orb has a real
shiny blue suitcase,

245
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:20,253
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

246
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,799
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

247
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:23,568
So what? What's the Orb?

248
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,870
I have no words for an honorless thief.

249
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,474
Pretty high and mighty coming from
the lackey of a genocidal maniac.

250
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,442
Yeah, I know who you are.

251
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:35,213
- Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

252
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,815
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

253
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:40,315
Yeah, you said that.

254
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,922
I wasn't retrieving the Orb
for Ronan. I was betraying him.

255
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:47,490
I had an agreement to
sell it to a third party.

256
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,394
I am Groot.

257
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:54,732
Well, that's just as fascinating as
the first 89 times you told me that.

258
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:57,001
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

259
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:59,303
Well, he don't know talking
good like me and you.

260
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:03,474
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

261
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:05,276
Exclusively in that order.

262
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,071
I tell you what, that's gonna
wear real thin, real fast.

263
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,872
Hey. Put that away.

264
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,818
Hey!

265
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,254
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

266
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:20,452
That's mine. Those belong to impound.
That tape and that player is mine!

267
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:28,564
Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973.
That song belongs to me!

268
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:51,148
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

269
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:53,784
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

270
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:58,582
You're scum! You're scum!

271
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,293
It's like I said,

272
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,228
she's got a rep.

273
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:06,297
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

274
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,466
to Ronan and his goons.

275
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,834
She'll last a day, tops.

276
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:11,502
Murderer!

277
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:13,137
The guards will protect her, right?

278
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:15,506
They're here to stop us from getting out.

279
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:17,575
They don't care what we
do to each other inside.

280
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:21,212
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

281
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,407
are dreams compared
to what's behind me.

282
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:28,886
Check out the new meat.

283
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:32,723
I'm gonna slather you
up in Gunavian jelly,

284
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:34,585
and go to town...

285
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,992
Let's make something clear.

286
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:45,225
This one here is our booty!

287
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:47,733
You wanna get to him,

288
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,067
you go through us!

289
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,110
Or, more accurately,

290
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,110
we go through you.

291
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:07,919
I'm with them.

292
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:11,118
I hate you.

293
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:14,453
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

294
00:27:26,677 --> 00:27:28,201
You're dead!

295
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:29,779
Dead!

296
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,341
Take her down to the showers.

297
00:27:57,441 --> 00:28:00,739
It'll be easier to clean
up the blood down there.

298
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,719
Quill, where you going?

299
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,082
Quill.

300
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:18,995
Quill!

301
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,033
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

302
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,269
for your crimes against the galaxy.

303
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,029
You dare?

304
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:35,074
You know who I am, yes?

305
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:36,680
You're Drax.

306
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,916
The Destroyer.

307
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:40,017
Quill!

308
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:42,086
And you know why they call me this.

309
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:45,211
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

310
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:48,692
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

311
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:51,226
and my daughter, Camaria.

312
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:53,791
He slaughtered them where they stood.

313
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:56,066
And he laughed!

314
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,134
Quill?

315
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:58,792
Her life

316
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:01,570
is not yours to take.

317
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,564
He killed my family.

318
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,435
I shall kill one of his in return.

319
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:10,906
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

320
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:19,152
Quill! What are you doing?

321
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:22,953
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

322
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:34,263
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

323
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:38,509
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

324
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:41,145
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Crap.

325
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:43,414
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

326
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:45,311
I don't think this is the
best way to go about it.

327
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:48,652
Are you not the man this
wench attempted to kill?

328
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:51,121
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first
woman to try and do that to me.

329
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:54,792
Look, this is from a
smoking-hot Rajak girl.

330
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:58,128
Stabbed me with a fork. Didn't like
me skipping out on her at sunrise.

331
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:00,798
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

332
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:04,068
She caught me with this skinny little
A'askavariian who worked in Nova Records.

333
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:07,571
I was trying to get information.
You ever see an A'askavariian?

334
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:09,540
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

335
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,335
If you think I'm seriously
interested in that, then...

336
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:15,868
You don't care. But here's the point.

337
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:20,412
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

338
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,210
And when he does,

339
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,650
that's when you...

340
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:28,158
Why would I put my
finger on his throat?

341
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:29,782
What?

342
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:32,596
No, it's a symbol.

343
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:37,368
This is a symbol for
you slicing his throat.

344
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,436
I would not slice his throat.

345
00:30:39,536 --> 00:30:42,306
I would cut his head clean off.

346
00:30:42,406 --> 00:30:44,508
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

347
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:46,143
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

348
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:47,678
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:49,905
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

350
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:55,017
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

351
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:58,084
Don't do his work for him.

352
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:13,469
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

353
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,307
- That was my favorite knife.
- Listen!

354
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,543
I could care less whether
you live or whether you die.

355
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:22,805
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

356
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:24,214
You know where to sell my Orb.

357
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:27,009
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

358
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,309
My friend Rocket, here,

359
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,182
has escaped 22 prisons.

360
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:32,523
We're getting out.

361
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:35,593
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

362
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:39,788
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

363
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,966
Four billion units.

364
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,901
- What?
- Holy shit.

365
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:48,028
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

366
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:49,964
If you free us,

367
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:54,745
I'll lead you to the buyer directly and I'll
split the profit between the three of us.

368
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:56,914
I am Groot.

369
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:58,082
Four of us.

370
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:01,751
Asleep for the danger, awake for
the money, as per frickin' usual.

371
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,123
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

372
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:08,350
We know only that
she has been captured.

373
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,961
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

374
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:15,499
No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

375
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,202
Look, your partnership with Thanos

376
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,497
is at risk.

377
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:24,998
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

378
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:34,151
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

379
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:35,753
and yet you summon me.

380
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,755
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

381
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,923
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

382
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:41,892
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

383
00:32:41,992 --> 00:32:44,762
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

384
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,664
You are the one here with
nothing to show for it.

385
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,868
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

386
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,302
Lower your tone!

387
00:32:52,402 --> 00:32:53,869
I may be your...

388
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:05,980
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

389
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,654
The only matter I do not
take seriously, boy,

390
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:12,482
is you.

391
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:15,325
Your politics bore me.

392
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:18,495
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

393
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:23,759
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

394
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,839
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

395
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:31,202
if you bring me the Orb.

396
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,633
But return to me again empty-handed,

397
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:38,112
and I will bathe the
starways in your blood.

398
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:43,349
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

399
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,385
This is one fight you won't win.

400
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:51,287
Let's head to the Kyln.

401
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:02,473
If we're gonna get out of here, we're
gonna need to get into that watchtower.

402
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,700
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

403
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:09,780
The guards wear security bands to
control their ins and outs. I need one.

404
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,315
Leave it to me.

405
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:14,218
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

406
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,053
- His leg?
- Yeah.

407
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:18,655
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

408
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:19,757
All right.

409
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:24,161
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

410
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:26,230
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

411
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,467
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

412
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,703
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

413
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:34,204
How are we supposed to do that?

414
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:36,573
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

415
00:34:36,673 --> 00:34:38,308
So, maybe you can work
out some sort of trade.

416
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:39,543
You must be joking.

417
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:41,411
No, I really heard they
find you attractive.

418
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:43,113
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

419
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:45,616
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

420
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,485
It's impossible to get up
there without being seen.

421
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:51,789
I got one plan, and that plan
requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

422
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,481
so figure it out!

423
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:56,326
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

424
00:34:56,426 --> 00:34:59,997
Now, this is important.
Once the battery is removed,

425
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,466
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

426
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:08,702
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,
so you definitely need to get that last.

427
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:16,079
Or we could just get
it first and improvise.

428
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:18,704
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

429
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,398
Prisoner, drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

430
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:36,829
or we will open fire.

431
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,541
I am

432
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:47,411
Groot!

433
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,342
Fire!

434
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:04,256
All prisoners return to
your sleeping areas.

435
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:10,801
You idiot!

436
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:14,097
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

437
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,511
The animal is in control.

438
00:36:21,611 --> 00:36:24,045
Fire on my command!

439
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,865
Creepy little beast!

440
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:54,467
Oh, yeah.

441
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:08,252
You need my what?

442
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,542
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

443
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,077
It's internally wired.

444
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:29,269
I'll figure something out.

445
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:33,917
Drop the leg!

446
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:37,077
Drop the leg and move
back to your cell!

447
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,332
Rocket!

448
00:37:55,672 --> 00:37:58,504
Move to the watchtower!

449
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,528
You!

450
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:33,132
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

451
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,636
It was one time, man.

452
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:40,972
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

453
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:04,839
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

454
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,998
Why is this one here?

455
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,646
We promised him he could stay by
your side until he kills your boss.

456
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:12,682
I always keep my promises,
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

457
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:14,510
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

458
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:17,654
I was just kidding about the leg.
I just need these two things.

459
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,456
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

460
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:22,459
Was it funny? Wait, what did
he look like hopping around?

461
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:24,959
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

462
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:28,955
How are we going to leave?

463
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,937
Well, he's got a plan. Right?
Or is that another thing you made up?

464
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:35,639
I have a plan! I have a plan!

465
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:39,076
Cease your yammering and relieve
us from this irksome confinement.

466
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:42,446
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the
walking thesaurus on that one.

467
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,480
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

468
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:46,917
It's just a metaphor, dude.

469
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,886
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

470
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,688
Nothing goes over my head.

471
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:55,348
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

472
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,825
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

473
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:07,364
Those are some big guns.

474
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,831
On my command!

475
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,774
Number one!

476
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:16,139
- Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
- Hold on!

477
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:19,476
Number two!

478
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:24,020
I recognize this animal. We'd roast
them over a flame pit as children.

479
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,723
- Their flesh was quite delicious.
- Not helping!

480
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:28,290
Number three!

481
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:37,033
All fire on my command!

482
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,602
Three!

483
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,237
Two!

484
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,963
One!

485
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:57,721
He turned off the artificial gravity,

486
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:00,255
everywhere but in here.

487
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:40,860
I told you I had a plan.

488
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:04,814
That was a pretty good plan.

489
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,200
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

490
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,970
It's the Milano, the orange and
blue one over in the corner.

491
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,871
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

492
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:24,439
That's rude! They folded yours.

493
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:34,284
The Orb's there. Let's go.

494
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:36,953
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

495
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:39,122
That bastard didn't put it back.

496
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:41,825
- Put what back?
- Here.

497
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:43,627
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

498
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,296
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the Milano close by.

499
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:47,731
Go.

500
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,559
Go!

501
00:43:09,352 --> 00:43:11,717
My neck!

502
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:17,560
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

503
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,596
He declined to share that
information with me.

504
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:21,163
Well, screw this, then!

505
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:25,068
I ain't waiting around for some humie with
a death wish. You got the Orb, right?

506
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:27,226
Yes.

507
00:43:49,392 --> 00:43:52,095
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

508
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:53,163
No!

509
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,731
We're not leaving without the Orb.

510
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,669
Behold.

511
00:44:12,715 --> 00:44:14,818
This one shows spirit.

512
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,854
He shall make a keen ally in
the battle against Ronan.

513
00:44:17,954 --> 00:44:20,888
Companion, what were you retrieving?

514
00:44:26,596 --> 00:44:28,586
You're an imbecile.

515
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:40,276
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

516
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:42,979
You can't take apart my
ship without asking me!

517
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,914
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

518
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:45,982
It's a bomb.

519
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:47,150
- A bomb?
- Yup.

520
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,952
And you leave it lying around?

521
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:50,653
I was gonna put it in a box.

522
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:51,855
What's a box gonna do?

523
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,157
- How about this one?
- No! Hey!

524
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:55,258
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

525
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:57,325
- Shut up.
- Hey!

526
00:44:58,127 --> 00:44:59,229
What is that?

527
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:02,432
That's for if things get really hardcore.

528
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:03,767
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

529
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,402
No one's blowing up moons.

530
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,670
You just wanna suck the
joy out of everything.

531
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,295
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

532
00:45:10,406 --> 00:45:13,176
We're heading in the
right direction. For now.

533
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:15,812
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

534
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:17,414
And how much do you trust me?

535
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,949
I'd trust you a lot more if
you told me what this was.

536
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:24,387
Because I'm guessing it's
some kind of weapon.

537
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:25,789
I don't know what it is.

538
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,224
If it's a weapon, we should
use it against Ronan.

539
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:30,260
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

540
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,428
Or just you, murderess!

541
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,196
I let you live once, princess!

542
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:35,398
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

543
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:39,525
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

544
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:43,373
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

545
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:45,675
I have no interest in money.

546
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:47,469
Great.

547
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:51,871
That means more money
for the three of us.

548
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:57,253
For the four of us. Partners.

549
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:01,046
We have an agreement, but I would
never be partners with the likes of you.

550
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:03,618
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

551
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,957
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

552
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:14,125
She has no idea.

553
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,239
If I had a black light,

554
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:19,307
the place would look like a
Jackson Pollock painting.

555
00:46:19,475 --> 00:46:21,636
You got issues, Quill.

556
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,979
I swear. I don't know where
they went! I swear.

557
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,959
If he knew where they were headed,
he would have already told us.

558
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,494
Yeah.

559
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:41,831
Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a
fleet to defend the prison.

560
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:46,369
Well, then, send Necrocraft to
every corner of the quadrant.

561
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:49,939
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

562
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:53,541
- And this place?
- The Nova can't know what we're after.

563
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:56,942
Cleanse it!

564
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,784
Do you got any other cute
little buggers like this one?

565
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:05,889
I like to stick 'em all in a
row on my control console.

566
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,091
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

567
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:10,326
He's being fully serious.

568
00:47:10,426 --> 00:47:13,121
In that case, I can show you...

569
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:15,598
But first, you gonna tell
me what this Orb is,

570
00:47:15,698 --> 00:47:18,359
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

571
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:20,303
And then you gonna tell me,

572
00:47:20,403 --> 00:47:22,539
who out there might wanna buy it.

573
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,801
Sir, the high-end community is a...

574
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:30,143
The high-end community is a...

575
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:31,881
It's a tight-knit...

576
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:33,249
Tight-knit...

577
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:35,544
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

578
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,154
I cannot possibly betray

579
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:40,415
the confidentiality of my buyers!

580
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,966
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

581
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,541
Carina.

582
00:47:58,641 --> 00:47:59,776
Yes, Master.

583
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:03,313
Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

584
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,847
We do, Master.

585
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:08,382
Then use them.

586
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:10,620
I don't have to remind you

587
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,190
what happened to the last
attendant who disappointed me.

588
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,189
Do I?

589
00:48:18,294 --> 00:48:23,026
Chop, chop. Our guests
will be here soon.

590
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:29,395
Heads up! We're inbound.

591
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:49,813
What is it?

592
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:52,362
It's called Knowhere.

593
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,732
The severed head of an
ancient celestial being.

594
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,095
Be wary headed in, rodent.

595
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:02,429
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

596
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:29,165
Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

597
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:31,834
to mine the organic
matter within the skull.

598
00:49:31,934 --> 00:49:34,237
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

599
00:49:34,337 --> 00:49:39,442
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

600
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:43,179
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

601
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:45,474
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

602
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:48,951
Billy the Kid, Bonnie
and Clyde, John Stamos.

603
00:49:49,051 --> 00:49:50,553
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

604
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:52,142
Yeah, you should.

605
00:49:53,122 --> 00:49:54,157
Excuse me.

606
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:57,089
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

607
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:06,158
Get out of here.

608
00:50:10,873 --> 00:50:13,276
Your buyer's in there?

609
00:50:13,376 --> 00:50:15,278
We are to wait here
for his representative.

610
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:16,879
Get out of here!

611
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:19,215
This is no respectable establishment.

612
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,840
What do you expect
us to do while we wait?

613
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:24,744
Yes! Yes!

614
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:35,195
Yahoo!

615
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:43,539
My Orloni has won,

616
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:45,902
as I won at all things!

617
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:48,845
Now, let's put more of
this liquid into our bodies.

618
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:53,313
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

619
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,319
Man, you wouldn't believe what
they charge for fuel out here.

620
00:50:56,419 --> 00:51:00,857
- I might actually lose money on this job.
- My connection is making us wait.

621
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,994
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

622
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:10,426
Where yours is more,
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

623
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,359
- My father didn't stress diplomacy.
- Thanos?

624
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:17,468
He's not my father.

625
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:22,539
When Thanos took my home world,
he killed my parents in front of me.

626
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:27,483
He tortured me,
turned me into a weapon.

627
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:31,621
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

628
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,155
I couldn't stand by and...

629
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:41,028
Why would you risk your life for this?

630
00:51:42,665 --> 00:51:44,689
My mother gave it to me.

631
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,005
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

632
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,473
I happened to have it on me,

633
00:51:50,573 --> 00:51:52,904
when I was...

634
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:55,472
The day that she...

635
00:51:57,413 --> 00:51:59,642
You know, when I left Earth.

636
00:52:00,082 --> 00:52:01,384
What do you do with it?

637
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:05,221
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

638
00:52:05,321 --> 00:52:09,992
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

639
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:11,360
Really?

640
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,665
On my planet, there's a
legend about people like you.

641
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,300
It's called

642
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,701
Footloose.

643
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:22,872
And in it, a great hero

644
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:24,700
named Kevin Bacon,

645
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:30,305
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

646
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,412
It's the greatest thing there is.

647
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:35,451
Who put the sticks up their butts?

648
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:37,019
What? No, that's just a...

649
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,988
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

650
00:52:39,088 --> 00:52:41,749
people use.

651
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,470
The melody is pleasant!

652
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:21,330
- No!
- What the hell?

653
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:22,832
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

654
00:53:22,932 --> 00:53:26,235
And I am not some starry-eyed
waif here to succumb to your...

655
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:28,537
Your pelvic sorcery!

656
00:53:28,637 --> 00:53:30,502
That is not what is happening here.

657
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,442
No.

658
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,857
Stop it!

659
00:53:47,957 --> 00:53:49,292
What are you doing?

660
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,528
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

661
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:54,597
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

662
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:57,099
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

663
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:59,368
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

664
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:01,537
You just wanna laugh at
me like everyone else!

665
00:54:01,637 --> 00:54:04,240
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

666
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,109
He thinks I'm some
stupid thing! He does!

667
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:09,612
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

668
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:11,781
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

669
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,883
and put back together, over and over

670
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:16,252
and turned into some...

671
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:17,420
Some little monster!

672
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,488
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

673
00:54:19,588 --> 00:54:21,757
He called me "vermin"!

674
00:54:21,857 --> 00:54:24,527
She called me "rodent"!

675
00:54:24,627 --> 00:54:25,962
Let's see if you can laugh

676
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,198
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

677
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:33,102
No, no, no, no!
Four billion units! Rocket!

678
00:54:33,202 --> 00:54:37,496
Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one
more lousy night and you're rich.

679
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:48,031
Fine. But I can't promise,

680
00:54:48,132 --> 00:54:50,686
when all this is over I'm not gonna
kill every last one of you jerks.

681
00:54:50,786 --> 00:54:54,744
See? That's exactly why none
of you have any friends!

682
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,526
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

683
00:54:57,626 --> 00:55:01,630
We have travelled,
halfway across the quadrant.

684
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,198
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

685
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:08,237
- Drax!
- Let him go.

686
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:09,997
We don't need him.

687
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,043
Milady Gamora.

688
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:16,406
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

689
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:24,553
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

690
00:55:24,653 --> 00:55:27,951
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

691
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,090
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

692
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:38,901
I present to you,

693
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:43,096
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

694
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:59,045
Oh, my dear Gamora.

695
00:55:59,388 --> 00:56:01,891
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

696
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:04,894
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

697
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,928
We have what we discussed.

698
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:13,035
What is that thing there?

699
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:15,296
I am Groot.

700
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:20,643
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

701
00:56:20,743 --> 00:56:22,642
Sir...

702
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:26,215
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

703
00:56:26,315 --> 00:56:29,251
At the moment of your death, of course.

704
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:30,653
I am Groot.

705
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:33,522
Why, so he could turn
you into a frickin' chair?

706
00:56:33,622 --> 00:56:35,089
That's your pet?

707
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:38,050
- His what?
- Tivan.

708
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:42,031
We have been halfway around
the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

709
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:44,233
Very well, then.

710
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:47,301
Let us see what you brought.

711
00:57:00,507 --> 00:57:03,310
Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

712
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:07,209
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

713
00:57:08,348 --> 00:57:11,585
You shall send a message for me.

714
00:57:11,685 --> 00:57:13,618
Oh, my new friends.

715
00:57:14,487 --> 00:57:17,691
Before creation itself,

716
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,952
there were six singularities.

717
00:57:21,761 --> 00:57:25,532
Then the universe
exploded into existence,

718
00:57:25,632 --> 00:57:27,734
and the remnants of these systems

719
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:31,735
were forged into concentrated ingots.

720
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:34,769
Infinity Stones.

721
00:57:35,475 --> 00:57:37,010
These stones, it seems,

722
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,979
can only be brandished

723
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:42,616
by beings of extraordinary strength.

724
00:57:42,716 --> 00:57:44,205
Observe.

725
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:52,793
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

726
00:57:52,893 --> 00:57:56,851
like wheat in a field.

727
00:57:57,898 --> 00:58:00,628
There's a little pee coming
out of me right now.

728
00:58:00,967 --> 00:58:02,269
Once, for a moment,

729
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:06,473
a group was able to share the
energy amongst themselves,

730
00:58:06,573 --> 00:58:10,008
but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.

731
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:17,876
Beautiful.

732
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:22,153
Beyond compare.

733
00:58:23,857 --> 00:58:27,986
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

734
00:58:29,429 --> 00:58:30,897
How would you like to get paid?

735
00:58:30,997 --> 00:58:33,488
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

736
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:36,025
Very well, then.

737
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:42,776
Carina.

738
00:58:42,876 --> 00:58:44,343
Stand back.

739
00:58:44,511 --> 00:58:47,214
I will no longer be your slave!

740
00:58:47,314 --> 00:58:49,247
No!

741
00:59:36,096 --> 00:59:37,620
What the...

742
00:59:46,607 --> 00:59:49,409
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

743
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:53,013
- What do you still have it for?
- What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

744
00:59:53,113 --> 00:59:56,983
- I can't believe you had that in your purse!
- It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

745
00:59:57,083 --> 01:00:00,754
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.
There's a chance they can contain it.

746
01:00:00,854 --> 01:00:03,658
Are you kidding me?
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.

747
01:00:03,759 --> 01:00:06,293
- Just give it to Ronan!
- So he can destroy the galaxy?

748
01:00:06,393 --> 01:00:08,194
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

749
01:00:08,294 --> 01:00:11,298
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

750
01:00:11,398 --> 01:00:13,199
Because I'm one of the
idiots who lives in it!

751
01:00:13,299 --> 01:00:18,071
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow
the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

752
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:21,508
We have to go back to your
ship, and deliver it to Nova.

753
01:00:21,608 --> 01:00:24,440
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

754
01:00:24,778 --> 01:00:28,748
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

755
01:00:28,848 --> 01:00:32,018
who's really nice for
a whole lot of money.

756
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:34,654
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

757
01:00:34,754 --> 01:00:37,923
You're despicable. Dishonorable.

758
01:00:38,091 --> 01:00:39,558
Faithless!

759
01:00:39,826 --> 01:00:41,816
- No.
- At last!

760
01:00:43,897 --> 01:00:46,466
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

761
01:00:46,566 --> 01:00:48,727
You called Ronan?

762
01:00:53,139 --> 01:00:56,631
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

763
01:00:57,343 --> 01:00:59,902
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

764
01:01:03,383 --> 01:01:05,785
Ronan the Accuser!

765
01:01:05,885 --> 01:01:08,421
You are the one who
transmitted the message?

766
01:01:08,521 --> 01:01:10,283
You killed my wife.

767
01:01:10,757 --> 01:01:13,020
You killed my daughter!

768
01:01:20,066 --> 01:01:24,332
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

769
01:01:29,509 --> 01:01:33,308
It is Gamora. She is
escaping with the Orb.

770
01:01:41,621 --> 01:01:43,289
No!

771
01:01:43,389 --> 01:01:44,856
Nebula,

772
01:01:45,225 --> 01:01:47,317
retrieve the Orb.

773
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:05,741
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

774
01:02:05,979 --> 01:02:07,707
Bring it down!

775
01:02:35,842 --> 01:02:39,045
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the Milano.

776
01:02:39,145 --> 01:02:41,581
How? We've got no
weaponry on these things.

777
01:02:41,681 --> 01:02:43,516
These pods are industrial grade.

778
01:02:43,616 --> 01:02:44,818
They're nearly indestructible.

779
01:02:44,918 --> 01:02:47,520
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

780
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,644
That's not what I'm saying.

781
01:03:37,704 --> 01:03:39,831
Let me borrow your ride.

782
01:04:12,171 --> 01:04:14,434
I don't recall killing your family.

783
01:04:17,277 --> 01:04:21,144
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

784
01:04:37,297 --> 01:04:40,595
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

785
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:42,234
I have to head out.

786
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,704
Wait! These things aren't
meant to go out there.

787
01:04:53,279 --> 01:04:55,610
You are a disappointment, sister.

788
01:04:55,948 --> 01:04:58,348
Of all our siblings,

789
01:04:58,718 --> 01:05:00,620
I hated you least.

790
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,988
Nebula, please.

791
01:05:02,088 --> 01:05:04,023
If Ronan gets this stone

792
01:05:04,123 --> 01:05:06,318
- he'll kill us all.
- Not all.

793
01:05:07,593 --> 01:05:09,720
You will already be dead.

794
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:07,218
Ronan, it is done.

795
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:11,311
Quill, come on.

796
01:06:11,424 --> 01:06:13,960
Her body mods should keep her
alive a couple more minutes,

797
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,129
but there's nothing we can do for her.

798
01:06:16,229 --> 01:06:17,797
These pods aren't
meant to be out here.

799
01:06:17,897 --> 01:06:20,763
In a second, we're gonna
be in the same boat.

800
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,570
Damn it.

801
01:06:31,444 --> 01:06:32,945
Quill?

802
01:06:33,045 --> 01:06:35,081
Yondu! Yondu.

803
01:06:35,181 --> 01:06:36,215
This is Quill!

804
01:06:36,315 --> 01:06:39,986
- My coordinates are 227 K324.
- Quill.

805
01:06:40,086 --> 01:06:41,321
Quill, what are you doing?

806
01:06:41,421 --> 01:06:42,922
Just outside Knowhere.

807
01:06:43,022 --> 01:06:45,615
If you're there, come get me.

808
01:06:45,858 --> 01:06:47,825
I'm all yours.

809
01:06:56,803 --> 01:06:59,237
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

810
01:07:00,373 --> 01:07:02,775
Get back into your pod!

811
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:06,401
You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.

812
01:07:07,146 --> 01:07:09,248
You'll die in seconds!

813
01:07:09,348 --> 01:07:10,940
Quill.

814
01:08:11,544 --> 01:08:13,705
Quill?

815
01:08:14,881 --> 01:08:16,814
What happened?

816
01:08:17,517 --> 01:08:20,008
I saw you out there.

817
01:08:20,987 --> 01:08:23,921
I don't know what came over me.

818
01:08:24,423 --> 01:08:26,686
But I couldn't let you die.

819
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:31,961
I found something inside of myself.

820
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:34,167
Something

821
01:08:34,267 --> 01:08:36,667
incredibly heroic.

822
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:40,573
I mean, not to brag,

823
01:08:40,673 --> 01:08:41,941
but, objectively...

824
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:43,530
Where's the Orb?

825
01:08:44,944 --> 01:08:47,246
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

826
01:08:47,346 --> 01:08:48,835
What?

827
01:08:51,117 --> 01:08:54,017
Welcome home, Peter.

828
01:09:16,442 --> 01:09:19,672
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

829
01:09:20,546 --> 01:09:22,849
Quill just got himself captured.

830
01:09:22,949 --> 01:09:27,320
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

831
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,114
take on a frickin' army!

832
01:09:30,423 --> 01:09:32,083
You're right.

833
01:09:34,327 --> 01:09:36,886
I was a fool.

834
01:09:38,898 --> 01:09:41,059
All the anger,

835
01:09:41,267 --> 01:09:43,564
all the rage,

836
01:09:46,272 --> 01:09:49,036
was just to cover my loss.

837
01:09:57,183 --> 01:09:59,981
"My wife and child are dead."

838
01:10:01,053 --> 01:10:03,322
I don't care if it's mean!

839
01:10:03,422 --> 01:10:05,753
Everybody's got dead people.

840
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,693
It's no excuse to get everybody else

841
01:10:07,793 --> 01:10:10,158
dead along the way!

842
01:10:13,532 --> 01:10:16,269
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

843
01:10:16,369 --> 01:10:19,572
The only chance we got is to get
to the other side of the universe

844
01:10:19,672 --> 01:10:21,641
as fast as we can and maybe,

845
01:10:21,741 --> 01:10:26,837
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

846
01:10:28,848 --> 01:10:30,249
I am Groot.

847
01:10:30,349 --> 01:10:32,718
Save them? How?

848
01:10:32,818 --> 01:10:35,655
I am Groot.

849
01:10:35,755 --> 01:10:38,391
I know they're the only
friends that we ever had,

850
01:10:38,491 --> 01:10:41,294
but there's an army of
Ravagers around them.

851
01:10:41,394 --> 01:10:43,452
And there's only two of us!

852
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:45,758
Three.

853
01:10:54,373 --> 01:10:56,676
You're making me

854
01:10:56,776 --> 01:10:58,411
beat... up

855
01:10:58,511 --> 01:10:59,978
grass!

856
01:11:02,048 --> 01:11:04,243
The Orb is in my possession,

857
01:11:04,884 --> 01:11:06,452
as I promised.

858
01:11:06,552 --> 01:11:08,187
Bring it to me.

859
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:12,052
Yes, that was our agreement.

860
01:11:12,324 --> 01:11:14,060
Bring you the Orb,

861
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,763
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

862
01:11:17,863 --> 01:11:22,468
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

863
01:11:22,568 --> 01:11:24,670
I wonder what use I have for you.

864
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:26,505
Boy,

865
01:11:26,605 --> 01:11:29,471
I would reconsider your current course.

866
01:11:30,176 --> 01:11:32,511
Master! You cannot!

867
01:11:32,611 --> 01:11:35,579
Thanos is the most powerful
being in the universe.

868
01:11:35,715 --> 01:11:37,842
Not anymore.

869
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:02,541
You call me "boy!"

870
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:07,246
I will unfurl 1,000 years
of Kree justice on Xandar,

871
01:12:07,346 --> 01:12:10,916
and burn it to its core!

872
01:12:11,016 --> 01:12:13,019
Then, Thanos,

873
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:15,553
I am coming for you.

874
01:12:17,456 --> 01:12:20,760
After Xandar, you are
going to kill my father?

875
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,762
You dare to oppose me?

876
01:12:22,862 --> 01:12:24,664
You see what he has turned me into.

877
01:12:24,764 --> 01:12:29,496
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

878
01:12:29,802 --> 01:12:31,769
You betray me?

879
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:33,272
Steal my money?

880
01:12:33,372 --> 01:12:35,274
Stop it! Leave him alone!

881
01:12:35,374 --> 01:12:37,510
When I picked you up as a kid,

882
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:40,012
these boys wanted to eat you.

883
01:12:40,112 --> 01:12:42,615
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

884
01:12:42,715 --> 01:12:44,383
I saved your life!

885
01:12:44,483 --> 01:12:46,719
Will you shut up about that? God!

886
01:12:46,819 --> 01:12:49,121
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

887
01:12:49,221 --> 01:12:51,924
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

888
01:12:52,024 --> 01:12:55,661
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

889
01:12:55,761 --> 01:12:58,297
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

890
01:12:58,397 --> 01:12:59,955
You abducted me, man.

891
01:13:00,533 --> 01:13:02,835
You stole me from my
home and from my family.

892
01:13:02,935 --> 01:13:05,471
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

893
01:13:05,571 --> 01:13:06,639
You're scared

894
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:08,841
because you're soft in here.

895
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:10,276
Here, right here!

896
01:13:10,376 --> 01:13:11,444
Yondu!

897
01:13:11,544 --> 01:13:12,745
Listen to me.

898
01:13:12,845 --> 01:13:15,081
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

899
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:17,116
I know what he's got, girl.

900
01:13:17,216 --> 01:13:19,552
Then you know we must get it back!

901
01:13:19,652 --> 01:13:23,122
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

902
01:13:23,222 --> 01:13:26,225
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

903
01:13:26,325 --> 01:13:28,961
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

904
01:13:29,061 --> 01:13:30,528
Sentiment?

905
01:13:31,564 --> 01:13:33,827
Eating away your brain like maggots!

906
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:40,002
That's it.

907
01:13:40,206 --> 01:13:41,607
No!

908
01:13:41,707 --> 01:13:42,875
Sorry, boy.

909
01:13:42,975 --> 01:13:46,545
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

910
01:13:46,645 --> 01:13:48,373
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

911
01:13:50,749 --> 01:13:53,052
If you kill me now,

912
01:13:53,152 --> 01:13:57,679
you are saying goodbye to the
biggest score you have ever seen.

913
01:14:02,394 --> 01:14:04,293
The Stone?

914
01:14:04,597 --> 01:14:06,599
I hope you got something
better than that.

915
01:14:06,699 --> 01:14:09,793
Because ain't nobody
stealing from Ronan.

916
01:14:10,536 --> 01:14:11,904
We got a ringer.

917
01:14:12,004 --> 01:14:13,903
Is that right?

918
01:14:14,573 --> 01:14:17,009
She knows everything there
is to know about Ronan.

919
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:18,410
His ships,

920
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,112
his army.

921
01:14:20,212 --> 01:14:22,509
He's vulnerable.

922
01:14:22,848 --> 01:14:24,150
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

923
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:28,277
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

924
01:14:35,527 --> 01:14:37,051
Let him go!

925
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:40,933
You always did have a scrote, boy!

926
01:14:41,033 --> 01:14:44,229
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

927
01:14:52,044 --> 01:14:54,079
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

928
01:14:54,179 --> 01:14:56,840
Attention, idiots.

929
01:14:58,484 --> 01:15:02,321
The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

930
01:15:02,421 --> 01:15:04,190
It's a weapon of my own design.

931
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:05,791
What the hell?

932
01:15:05,891 --> 01:15:08,661
If you don't hand over
our companions now,

933
01:15:08,761 --> 01:15:11,130
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

934
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:13,065
A very big new one!

935
01:15:13,165 --> 01:15:16,435
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

936
01:15:16,535 --> 01:15:19,705
- 5, 4, 3...
- No! Wait, hold on!

937
01:15:19,805 --> 01:15:21,640
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

938
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:23,809
We figured it out! We're fine!

939
01:15:23,909 --> 01:15:25,569
Hey, Quill. What's going on?

940
01:15:27,012 --> 01:15:28,647
You call that "figured it out"?

941
01:15:28,747 --> 01:15:31,116
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

942
01:15:31,216 --> 01:15:32,651
You want to talk about senseless?

943
01:15:32,751 --> 01:15:35,020
How about trying to save
us by blowing us up?

944
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,957
We were only gonna blow you
up if they didn't turn you over!

945
01:15:38,057 --> 01:15:39,925
And how on earth were
they gonna turn us over

946
01:15:40,025 --> 01:15:41,560
when you only gave
them a count of five?

947
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:45,164
We didn't have time to work
out the minutiae of the plan.

948
01:15:45,264 --> 01:15:47,533
This is what we get for
acting altruistically.

949
01:15:47,633 --> 01:15:49,802
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

950
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:53,973
What's important now is we get the
Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.

951
01:15:54,273 --> 01:15:57,843
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's
just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

952
01:15:57,943 --> 01:16:01,013
- We'll figure that part out later.
- We have to stop Ronan.

953
01:16:01,113 --> 01:16:02,581
How?

954
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:05,251
- I have a plan.
- You've got a plan?

955
01:16:05,351 --> 01:16:06,418
Yes.

956
01:16:06,519 --> 01:16:08,940
First of all, you're copying me
from when I said I had a plan.

957
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:12,558
No, I'm not. People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

958
01:16:12,658 --> 01:16:14,560
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

959
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,463
I have part of a plan!

960
01:16:17,563 --> 01:16:19,098
What percentage of
a plan do you have?

961
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:22,401
You don't get to ask questions after
the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

962
01:16:22,501 --> 01:16:24,136
I just saved Quill.

963
01:16:24,236 --> 01:16:26,972
We've already established that you destroying
the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

964
01:16:27,072 --> 01:16:29,308
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

965
01:16:29,408 --> 01:16:31,432
I wasn't listening. I was
thinking of something else.

966
01:16:32,077 --> 01:16:35,147
She's right. You don't get an opinion.
What percentage?

967
01:16:35,247 --> 01:16:38,479
- I don't know. Twelve percent.
- Twelve percent?

968
01:16:40,019 --> 01:16:41,220
That's a fake laugh.

969
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,055
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

970
01:16:43,155 --> 01:16:47,826
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

971
01:16:47,926 --> 01:16:50,362
- because that is not a plan.
- It's barely a concept.

972
01:16:50,462 --> 01:16:53,065
- You're taking their side?
- I am Groot.

973
01:16:53,165 --> 01:16:56,101
So what, it's better than 11%? What the
hell does that have to do with anything?

974
01:16:56,201 --> 01:16:58,837
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

975
01:16:58,937 --> 01:17:02,838
See? Groot's the only one
of you who has a clue.

976
01:17:07,413 --> 01:17:08,902
Guys.

977
01:17:09,281 --> 01:17:10,416
Come on.

978
01:17:10,516 --> 01:17:12,518
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

979
01:17:12,618 --> 01:17:15,586
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

980
01:17:16,488 --> 01:17:18,853
I need your help.

981
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:22,861
I look around at us.

982
01:17:22,961 --> 01:17:24,450
You know what I see?

983
01:17:24,963 --> 01:17:26,430
Losers.

984
01:17:28,634 --> 01:17:30,235
I mean, like,

985
01:17:30,335 --> 01:17:32,271
folks who have lost stuff.

986
01:17:32,371 --> 01:17:34,998
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

987
01:17:35,674 --> 01:17:37,436
Our homes,

988
01:17:37,709 --> 01:17:39,540
our families,

989
01:17:40,212 --> 01:17:42,181
normal lives.

990
01:17:42,281 --> 01:17:45,477
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

991
01:17:45,851 --> 01:17:47,453
Today, it's given us something.

992
01:17:47,553 --> 01:17:49,154
It has given us a chance.

993
01:17:49,254 --> 01:17:51,051
To do what?

994
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:54,253
To give a shit.

995
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,462
For once.

996
01:17:56,562 --> 01:17:59,030
Not run away.

997
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,902
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

998
01:18:04,002 --> 01:18:07,528
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

999
01:18:08,173 --> 01:18:11,233
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1000
01:18:11,877 --> 01:18:14,313
it's impossible.

1001
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:17,177
You're asking us to die.

1002
01:18:23,388 --> 01:18:25,719
Yeah, I guess I am.

1003
01:18:38,103 --> 01:18:39,695
Quill.

1004
01:18:43,408 --> 01:18:47,207
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1005
01:18:50,782 --> 01:18:55,446
I will be grateful to
die among my friends.

1006
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:01,691
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1007
01:19:02,928 --> 01:19:05,589
I will fight beside you.

1008
01:19:06,331 --> 01:19:08,298
And in the end,

1009
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:12,292
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1010
01:19:17,809 --> 01:19:21,437
I am Groot.

1011
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:34,987
What the hell. I don't got
that long a lifespan, anyway.

1012
01:19:40,532 --> 01:19:43,168
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1013
01:19:43,268 --> 01:19:45,504
We're all standing up now.

1014
01:19:45,604 --> 01:19:49,301
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1015
01:19:56,081 --> 01:19:57,649
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1016
01:19:57,749 --> 01:19:59,785
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1017
01:19:59,885 --> 01:20:03,122
All Ronan's got to do is touch the
Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

1018
01:20:03,222 --> 01:20:04,923
All plants, animals,

1019
01:20:05,023 --> 01:20:06,956
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

1020
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:09,559
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1021
01:20:12,064 --> 01:20:14,099
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

1022
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:16,401
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1023
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:20,572
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1024
01:20:20,672 --> 01:20:23,442
Won't there be hundreds of
Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1025
01:20:23,542 --> 01:20:26,840
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1026
01:20:32,217 --> 01:20:33,652
Once they know we're on board,

1027
01:20:33,752 --> 01:20:37,156
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1028
01:20:37,256 --> 01:20:39,758
Which I can disable by
dismantling the power source.

1029
01:20:39,858 --> 01:20:41,560
We'll make it to the flight deck,

1030
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:45,129
and I'll use the Hadron
Enforcer to kill Ronan.

1031
01:20:47,232 --> 01:20:50,702
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

1032
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:53,238
Use these devices to contain it.

1033
01:20:53,338 --> 01:20:55,135
If you touch it,

1034
01:20:55,407 --> 01:20:57,204
it will kill you.

1035
01:20:59,578 --> 01:21:02,814
I'll contact one of the Nova
officers who arrested us.

1036
01:21:02,914 --> 01:21:06,008
Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.

1037
01:21:06,118 --> 01:21:09,746
There's one more thing we
need to complete the plan.

1038
01:21:10,055 --> 01:21:11,715
That guy's eye.

1039
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,760
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1040
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,657
that guy's eye.

1041
01:21:17,296 --> 01:21:20,356
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1042
01:21:24,569 --> 01:21:27,506
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,
and will arrive in T-minus

1043
01:21:27,606 --> 01:21:29,508
fifteen minutes.

1044
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:31,443
Remember, boy.

1045
01:21:31,543 --> 01:21:33,478
At the end of all this,

1046
01:21:33,578 --> 01:21:34,913
I get the Stone.

1047
01:21:35,013 --> 01:21:37,913
You cross me, we kill you all.

1048
01:22:00,105 --> 01:22:01,902
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1049
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:12,251
This is a terrible plan.

1050
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:14,910
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1051
01:22:19,391 --> 01:22:20,858
Nova Prime.

1052
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,362
I received a transmission

1053
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:25,156
from one of the Ravagers.

1054
01:22:25,263 --> 01:22:27,899
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1055
01:22:27,999 --> 01:22:29,368
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1056
01:22:29,468 --> 01:22:30,736
Good God.

1057
01:22:30,836 --> 01:22:32,804
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1058
01:22:32,904 --> 01:22:35,374
Did he say why we should believe him?

1059
01:22:35,474 --> 01:22:37,709
He said his crew just
escaped from prison

1060
01:22:37,809 --> 01:22:41,244
so he'd have no other reason to
risk coming to Xandar to help.

1061
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,206
He says that he's an

1062
01:22:43,815 --> 01:22:45,117
"a-hole."

1063
01:22:45,217 --> 01:22:46,485
But he's not,

1064
01:22:46,585 --> 01:22:48,320
and I'm quoting him, here,

1065
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,722
"100% a dick."

1066
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:52,584
Do you believe him?

1067
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:55,827
I don't know that I believe
anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1068
01:22:55,927 --> 01:22:59,328
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1069
01:23:02,567 --> 01:23:04,034
Yeah.

1070
01:23:13,678 --> 01:23:15,480
A fleet approaches.

1071
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,638
They appear to be Ravagers.

1072
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:29,818
Fire!

1073
01:23:40,705 --> 01:23:41,940
Cover it down.

1074
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,405
Submerge!

1075
01:23:56,888 --> 01:23:58,548
Rocket, hurry!

1076
01:24:04,596 --> 01:24:05,864
All pilots, dive!

1077
01:24:05,964 --> 01:24:07,590
They're beneath us!

1078
01:24:15,974 --> 01:24:17,442
Evacuate the city.

1079
01:24:17,542 --> 01:24:21,500
Our priority is to get our
people away from the battle.

1080
01:24:28,019 --> 01:24:29,508
Forward thrust, now!

1081
01:24:42,601 --> 01:24:44,068
Come on!

1082
01:24:45,303 --> 01:24:47,327
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1083
01:25:09,194 --> 01:25:10,762
Hell!

1084
01:25:10,862 --> 01:25:12,364
I'm going down, Quill!

1085
01:25:12,464 --> 01:25:14,266
No more games with me, boy!

1086
01:25:14,366 --> 01:25:15,467
I'll see you

1087
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:17,762
at the end of this!

1088
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:25,473
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1089
01:25:25,777 --> 01:25:27,972
We'll never make it up there!

1090
01:25:42,527 --> 01:25:43,728
Peter Quill.

1091
01:25:43,828 --> 01:25:46,264
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

1092
01:25:46,364 --> 01:25:49,734
For the record, I advised
against trusting you here.

1093
01:25:49,834 --> 01:25:51,536
They got my "dick" message!

1094
01:25:51,636 --> 01:25:53,262
Prove me wrong.

1095
01:26:00,245 --> 01:26:02,576
Yes!

1096
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:24,859
Yes!

1097
01:26:27,839 --> 01:26:29,966
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1098
01:26:33,745 --> 01:26:35,313
The starboard kern has been breached!

1099
01:26:35,413 --> 01:26:36,715
We have been boarded.

1100
01:26:36,815 --> 01:26:38,283
Continue our approach.

1101
01:26:38,383 --> 01:26:39,718
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1102
01:26:39,818 --> 01:26:42,487
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1103
01:26:42,587 --> 01:26:43,688
Seal security doors!

1104
01:26:43,788 --> 01:26:45,277
Now!

1105
01:26:46,591 --> 01:26:49,321
Get out of my way!

1106
01:27:00,105 --> 01:27:01,673
Oh, man.

1107
01:27:01,773 --> 01:27:06,211
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1108
01:27:06,311 --> 01:27:10,611
The Dark Aster must
not reach the ground.

1109
01:27:22,694 --> 01:27:24,320
Locked in!

1110
01:27:24,729 --> 01:27:26,321
Locked in.

1111
01:27:27,465 --> 01:27:28,932
We're locked in.

1112
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:09,364
I can barely see.

1113
01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:37,469
When did you learn to do that?

1114
01:28:37,569 --> 01:28:38,737
Pretty sure the answer is

1115
01:28:38,837 --> 01:28:40,861
"I am Groot."

1116
01:28:41,573 --> 01:28:44,541
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1117
01:28:47,345 --> 01:28:51,149
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1118
01:28:51,249 --> 01:28:53,944
It is pleasing to once again have

1119
01:28:54,085 --> 01:28:55,552
friends.

1120
01:28:56,187 --> 01:28:59,057
You, Quill, are my friend.

1121
01:28:59,157 --> 01:29:00,425
Thanks.

1122
01:29:00,525 --> 01:29:03,084
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1123
01:29:04,763 --> 01:29:08,064
- And this green whore, she, too...
- You must stop!

1124
01:29:10,502 --> 01:29:16,107
Gamora, look at what you have done.
You have always been weak.

1125
01:29:16,207 --> 01:29:18,766
You stupid, traitorous...

1126
01:29:23,515 --> 01:29:26,279
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1127
01:29:26,951 --> 01:29:31,279
Head to the flight deck. I'll shut
down the power to the security doors.

1128
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:40,699
Yondu Udonta.

1129
01:29:40,799 --> 01:29:44,757
Order your men to turn
on the Nova Corps.

1130
01:30:01,085 --> 01:30:02,687
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1131
01:30:02,787 --> 01:30:05,050
Time to die...

1132
01:30:37,288 --> 01:30:38,777
Nebula, please.

1133
01:30:52,837 --> 01:30:55,640
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1134
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:58,265
enact immolation initiative.

1135
01:31:01,346 --> 01:31:02,847
They're dive-bombing the city!

1136
01:31:02,947 --> 01:31:04,783
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1137
01:31:04,883 --> 01:31:06,975
No! Hold your positions.

1138
01:31:38,182 --> 01:31:39,651
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1139
01:31:39,751 --> 01:31:41,386
We'll take care of the
people down here.

1140
01:31:41,486 --> 01:31:44,113
I can't believe I'm taking
orders from a hamster.

1141
01:31:46,858 --> 01:31:48,459
Star-Lord.

1142
01:31:48,559 --> 01:31:50,026
Finally.

1143
01:32:00,471 --> 01:32:01,995
You thief!

1144
01:32:13,418 --> 01:32:16,716
You will never make it to Ronan.

1145
01:32:21,993 --> 01:32:24,723
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1146
01:32:32,904 --> 01:32:34,735
Come on!

1147
01:33:17,115 --> 01:33:21,051
Finger to the throat means death.

1148
01:33:26,424 --> 01:33:27,892
Metaphor.

1149
01:33:27,992 --> 01:33:29,327
Yeah, sorta.

1150
01:33:29,427 --> 01:33:31,053
No.

1151
01:33:58,556 --> 01:34:00,455
Xandar!

1152
01:34:00,658 --> 01:34:03,718
You stand accused.

1153
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:07,165
Your wretched peace treaty will not

1154
01:34:07,265 --> 01:34:08,866
save you now.

1155
01:34:08,966 --> 01:34:12,663
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1156
01:34:36,828 --> 01:34:37,895
Rocket!

1157
01:34:37,995 --> 01:34:40,224
Hold on, Saal, just...

1158
01:35:06,524 --> 01:35:07,792
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1159
01:35:07,892 --> 01:35:09,527
The city's been evacuated,

1160
01:35:09,627 --> 01:35:12,196
but we're getting our
asses kicked down here.

1161
01:35:12,296 --> 01:35:14,195
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1162
01:35:38,456 --> 01:35:39,923
Nebula!

1163
01:35:41,025 --> 01:35:43,628
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1164
01:35:43,728 --> 01:35:45,563
You know he's crazy.

1165
01:35:45,663 --> 01:35:47,765
I know you're both crazy.

1166
01:35:47,865 --> 01:35:49,491
No!

1167
01:35:51,936 --> 01:35:53,403
What the?

1168
01:35:54,205 --> 01:35:56,195
Get out!

1169
01:36:37,148 --> 01:36:38,615
You did it!

1170
01:37:04,675 --> 01:37:05,943
I was mistaken.

1171
01:37:06,043 --> 01:37:08,101
I do remember your family.

1172
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:10,081
Their screams were

1173
01:37:10,181 --> 01:37:12,740
pitiful. I...

1174
01:39:09,433 --> 01:39:10,991
No, Groot!

1175
01:39:11,135 --> 01:39:12,236
You can't.

1176
01:39:12,336 --> 01:39:14,269
You'll die.

1177
01:39:14,372 --> 01:39:16,274
Why are you doing this?

1178
01:39:16,374 --> 01:39:18,307
Why?

1179
01:39:24,482 --> 01:39:26,350
We

1180
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:27,939
are

1181
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:30,052
Groot.

1182
01:40:34,018 --> 01:40:36,509
I called him an idiot.

1183
01:40:58,776 --> 01:41:01,176
You killed Groot!

1184
01:41:04,882 --> 01:41:06,610
Behold!

1185
01:41:07,084 --> 01:41:10,521
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1186
01:41:10,621 --> 01:41:13,057
What fruit have they wrought?

1187
01:41:13,157 --> 01:41:17,261
Only that my father and his father

1188
01:41:17,361 --> 01:41:20,998
shall finally know vengeance.

1189
01:41:21,098 --> 01:41:23,793
People of Xandar,

1190
01:41:23,968 --> 01:41:25,770
the time has come

1191
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:28,739
to rejoice and renounce

1192
01:41:28,839 --> 01:41:31,534
your paltry gods!

1193
01:41:31,909 --> 01:41:35,708
Your salvation is at hand.

1194
01:41:47,992 --> 01:41:49,959
Listen to these words.

1195
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:00,696
Now bring it down hard!

1196
01:42:03,674 --> 01:42:05,142
What are you doing?

1197
01:42:05,242 --> 01:42:08,267
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1198
01:42:11,248 --> 01:42:13,113
Gamora.

1199
01:42:13,684 --> 01:42:16,086
Subtle. Take it back.

1200
01:42:16,186 --> 01:42:18,622
What are you doing?

1201
01:42:18,722 --> 01:42:21,520
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

1202
01:42:37,274 --> 01:42:39,264
No!

1203
01:43:12,776 --> 01:43:16,370
Peter! Take my hand!

1204
01:43:21,318 --> 01:43:23,786
Take my hand, Peter.

1205
01:43:24,254 --> 01:43:26,056
Mom.

1206
01:43:26,156 --> 01:43:28,681
Take my hand!

1207
01:44:22,646 --> 01:44:24,682
You're mortal!

1208
01:44:24,782 --> 01:44:26,116
How?

1209
01:44:26,216 --> 01:44:28,419
You said it yourself, bitch.

1210
01:44:28,519 --> 01:44:31,351
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1211
01:45:00,751 --> 01:45:02,419
Well, well, well.

1212
01:45:02,519 --> 01:45:04,043
Quite the light show.

1213
01:45:05,889 --> 01:45:08,016
Ain't this sweet.

1214
01:45:09,126 --> 01:45:11,662
But you got some business to attend to

1215
01:45:11,762 --> 01:45:14,662
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1216
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:18,135
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1217
01:45:18,235 --> 01:45:22,339
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1218
01:45:22,439 --> 01:45:26,668
but the only way the universe can survive
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1219
01:45:27,044 --> 01:45:29,671
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1220
01:45:31,482 --> 01:45:33,813
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1221
01:45:35,052 --> 01:45:37,019
Hand it over, son.

1222
01:45:53,403 --> 01:45:54,870
Yondu.

1223
01:45:57,508 --> 01:46:01,239
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1224
01:46:01,411 --> 01:46:04,345
You've seen what it does to people.

1225
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:17,320
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1226
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:20,364
It's probably good we didn't
deliver him to his dad

1227
01:46:20,464 --> 01:46:21,465
like we was hired to do.

1228
01:46:21,565 --> 01:46:24,761
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1229
01:46:29,173 --> 01:46:33,200
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1230
01:46:35,479 --> 01:46:37,776
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1231
01:46:38,549 --> 01:46:40,676
I know.

1232
01:46:42,085 --> 01:46:44,177
But he was about the only family I had.

1233
01:46:46,623 --> 01:46:48,112
No.

1234
01:46:48,926 --> 01:46:50,586
He wasn't.

1235
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:39,943
Why would you even know this?

1236
01:47:40,043 --> 01:47:42,780
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1237
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,745
so we had it checked out.

1238
01:47:45,582 --> 01:47:47,284
I'm not Terran?

1239
01:47:47,384 --> 01:47:48,952
You are half Terran.

1240
01:47:49,052 --> 01:47:52,756
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1241
01:47:52,856 --> 01:47:56,627
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1242
01:47:56,727 --> 01:48:00,756
That could be why you were able to
hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1243
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:02,665
Your friends have arrived.

1244
01:48:04,101 --> 01:48:06,670
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1245
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:12,368
we'd like to express our profound
gratitude for your help in saving Xandar.

1246
01:48:13,744 --> 01:48:16,513
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1247
01:48:16,613 --> 01:48:20,377
- he has something to show you.
- Thank you, Nova Prime.

1248
01:48:28,725 --> 01:48:33,630
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1249
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:34,965
Yes.

1250
01:48:35,065 --> 01:48:37,430
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1251
01:48:37,734 --> 01:48:40,361
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1252
01:48:42,572 --> 01:48:45,802
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1253
01:48:45,943 --> 01:48:48,377
We salvaged as much as we could.

1254
01:48:51,014 --> 01:48:52,481
I...

1255
01:48:54,017 --> 01:48:55,575
Thank you.

1256
01:48:56,687 --> 01:48:58,755
I have a family.

1257
01:48:58,855 --> 01:49:00,788
They're alive because of you.

1258
01:49:05,028 --> 01:49:07,464
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1259
01:49:07,564 --> 01:49:11,966
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1260
01:49:12,135 --> 01:49:14,438
Question. What if I see
something that I want to take,

1261
01:49:14,538 --> 01:49:17,207
- and it belongs to someone else?
- You will be arrested.

1262
01:49:17,307 --> 01:49:19,910
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1263
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:21,812
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1264
01:49:21,912 --> 01:49:24,648
No, I want it more, sir. Do you
understand? What are you laughing at?

1265
01:49:24,748 --> 01:49:26,583
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1266
01:49:26,683 --> 01:49:28,585
What if someone does
something irksome

1267
01:49:28,685 --> 01:49:31,346
and I decide to remove his spine?

1268
01:49:32,456 --> 01:49:34,014
That's...

1269
01:49:34,658 --> 01:49:37,319
That's actually murder.

1270
01:49:38,662 --> 01:49:41,265
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1271
01:49:41,365 --> 01:49:44,663
So... also illegal.

1272
01:49:47,804 --> 01:49:49,293
They'll be fine, Dey.

1273
01:49:49,539 --> 01:49:50,774
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1274
01:49:50,874 --> 01:49:52,341
You?

1275
01:49:55,345 --> 01:49:58,780
Yeah. Me.

1276
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:19,290
Peter,

1277
01:50:19,403 --> 01:50:23,202
I know these last few months
have been hard for you.

1278
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:26,710
But I'm going to a better place.

1279
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:29,313
And I will be okay.

1280
01:50:29,413 --> 01:50:33,610
And I will always be with you.

1281
01:50:34,851 --> 01:50:37,587
You are the light of my life.

1282
01:50:37,687 --> 01:50:40,382
My precious son.

1283
01:50:40,891 --> 01:50:44,292
My little Star-Lord.

1284
01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:46,995
Love, Mom.

1285
01:52:47,117 --> 01:52:48,985
So, what should we do next?

1286
01:52:49,085 --> 01:52:50,552
Something good?

1287
01:52:51,121 --> 01:52:52,622
Something bad?

1288
01:52:52,722 --> 01:52:54,814
A bit of both?

1289
01:52:55,992 --> 01:52:59,359
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1290
01:53:01,164 --> 01:53:02,653
Bit of both.

1291
02:00:26,542 --> 02:00:29,306
What do you let it lick you like that for?

1292
02:00:30,179 --> 02:00:32,203
Gross.

1293
02:00:34,784 --> 02:00:36,351
Yeah!

1294
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:38,649
But it burns going down.
