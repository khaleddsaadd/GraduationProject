2
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:16,812
Do you know
what time it is?

3
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,645
Can't sleep.

4
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,914
There are tabs
for that.

5
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,718
Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.

6
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,786
Dreams again?

7
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:30,659
Wanna fight?

8
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:35,428
I slipped.

9
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,363
Right, you slipped

10
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,365
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

11
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,264
I was already slipping

12
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:40,533
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

13
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,136
The two events
were not related.

14
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,705
Tell me about this dream.

15
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,744
- Anything new?
- No.

16
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,714
You have to let go
of the past.

17
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,982
I don't remember my past.

18
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,651
It's causing you doubt,

19
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,454
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.

20
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:08,664
Control it.

21
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,532
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

22
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:14,000
with the
Supreme Intelligence.

23
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:16,872
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

24
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:22,176
Humor is a distraction.

25
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:26,379
And anger?

26
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,816
Anger only serves
the enemy.

27
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:40,660
<i>One hundred twenty days</i>

28
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:42,696
<i>since the last Skrull attack.</i>

29
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:44,030
<i>Has anyone ever seen</i>

30
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,865
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

31
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:48,635
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

32
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:49,905
in its true form.

33
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:53,006
You know that.

34
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:55,742
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

35
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:59,278
So it's sacred.
It's personal.

36
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,414
No Kree divulges it, ever.

37
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,417
Who do you see?

38
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,584
- Your brother?
- No.

39
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:05,852
- Father?
- No.

40
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,021
- Your old commander?
- Vers.

41
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:09,424
It's me you see,
isn't it?

42
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,425
I see
what you're trying to do.

43
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:13,893
- Is it working?
- Yes.

44
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:15,762
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

45
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:18,364
What is the point
of giving me these...

46
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,066
if you don't want me
to use them?

47
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:21,935
I want you to use them.

48
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:23,837
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

49
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,805
of showing you
how to use them.

50
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,673
I know how.

51
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:27,974
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

52
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,977
knock me down without them.

53
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:32,781
Control your impulses.

54
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:36,916
Stop using this,
start using this.

55
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,922
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

56
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:23,297
Vers.

57
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:26,065
Intelligence.

58
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:29,135
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

59
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:30,804
I am.

60
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:34,407
You struggle
with your emotions...

61
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,778
with your past,
which fuels them.

62
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,714
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

63
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,918
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

64
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,987
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...

65
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,991
then take over our planets.

66
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:53,693
Horrors that you remember...

67
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:56,331
and so much that you do not.

68
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,736
It's all blank.
My life.

69
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,438
You're supposed
to take the form

70
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,106
of who I most admire...

71
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:11,744
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

72
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,813
Perhaps this is a mercy

73
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:16,749
sparing you
from a deeper pain.

74
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,653
Freeing you to do
what all Kree must...

75
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:23,156
put your people's needs
before your own.

76
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:25,692
We've given you
a great gift.

77
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:28,129
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

78
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:30,964
I want to serve.

79
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:33,032
Then master yourself.

80
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,704
What was given
can be taken away.

81
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,174
I won't let you down.

82
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:43,411
We'll know soon enough.

83
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:45,480
You have a mission.

84
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:49,150
Serve well, and with honor.

85
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:11,771
This can't be good.

86
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:13,806
Must be another
Skrull attack.

87
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,143
Whatever it is, it's big.

88
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,677
Has a Skrull
ever simmed you?

89
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:18,845
Once.

90
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:21,214
- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?

91
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,616
Because I stared into the
face of my mortal enemy...

92
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:25,852
and the face staring back
was my own.

93
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:27,053
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

94
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,688
then it would be
less disturbing.

95
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,790
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

96
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,025
You never laugh.

97
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:35,094
I laugh on the inside.

98
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,496
I'm not doing that now.

99
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,664
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

100
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,865
you're quite handsome.

101
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,066
Well, thank you.

102
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,669
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

103
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,705
All right.

104
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:47,573
Prepare for...

105
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:50,510
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

106
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,780
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

107
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:55,748
This time, Torfa.

108
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,849
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

109
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,155
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

110
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,723
The Skrull general, Talos,

111
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:05,591
has sent kill units
to find him.

112
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:07,160
Should they reach him
before we do...

113
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:08,561
the intelligence
he's acquired

114
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:10,131
over three years
is as good as theirs.

115
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:13,066
The Accusers will bomb

116
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:15,168
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

117
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,638
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

118
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,774
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

119
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:24,043
The Torfan populace.

120
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,545
We are not to interfere
with them,

121
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,546
nor them with us.

122
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:30,083
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

123
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,085
Proceed with caution.

124
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:34,255
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

125
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,724
This is
a dangerous mission.

126
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,660
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

127
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:42,128
if that is our fate today.

128
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,262
For the good of all Kree.

129
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:44,265
For the good
of all Kree!

130
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,203
Vers,
track Soh-Larr's beacon.

131
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,908
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

132
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:20,195
Locals on the periphery.

133
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:22,695
Maybe a dozen.

134
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:24,130
Minn-Erva?

135
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,169
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

136
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:30,169
Repeat.

137
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:46,285
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

138
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:48,888
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

139
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,123
Only one way in,
only one way out.

140
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,858
We can get past the locals.

141
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,461
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.

142
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:55,862
You don't have to go
with me. I'll go alone.

143
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:56,865
No, you won't.

144
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,003
Right. We keep a close radius.

145
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,040
We lose comms,
we meet back at the <i>Helion.</i>

146
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:08,276
Come on.

147
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:22,088
Att-Lass, you getting this?

148
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,392
Copy. I see them.

149
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:34,769
Get back!

150
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:36,338
Commander?

151
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:46,946
Get back! Back!

152
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:49,717
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

153
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,952
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

154
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:54,756
Does anybody copy?

155
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,128
I don't wanna hurt you.

156
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:03,965
Keep back!

157
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:08,370
Stay back!

158
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:15,141
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

159
00:12:15,143 --> 00:12:16,844
They're just starving.

160
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,036
HGX-78.

161
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:46,841
TRT79-VVX6.

162
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:51,246
Get back.

163
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,489
Skrulls!

164
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,373
Vers!

165
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,575
<i>Vers? Skrulls.</i>

166
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:23,445
<i>It's an ambush.</i>

167
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,465
Incoming!

168
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,470
Back to the <i>Helion.</i>

169
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:51,806
<i>Vers. Do you copy?</i>

170
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,408
<i>Back to the</i> Helion.

171
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,642
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>

172
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:58,177
How did you know the code?

173
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:00,416
How about
I tell you my secret...

174
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,453
when you've told me yours?

175
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,491
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

176
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,136
<i>Where are we?</i>

177
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:25,474
<i>Stand by.</i>

178
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:28,477
Where's your head at?

179
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:32,011
In the clouds.
Where's yours?

180
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:33,513
On my shoulders.

181
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:35,349
About to show these boys
how we do it.

182
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:36,916
You ready?

183
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:37,983
Higher, further,
faster, baby.

184
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:38,986
That's right.

185
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:50,298
<i>This can't be right.</i>

186
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:54,166
<i>Go back even further.</i>

187
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:00,241
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

188
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:16,390
<i>Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?</i>

189
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:17,524
What the hell
are you thinking?

190
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:18,558
You don't belong out here!

191
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,259
<i>I think
we went back too far.</i>

192
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:21,661
You let him drive.

193
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,164
<i>Let me try something.</i>

194
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,966
Give up already!

195
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,470
You don't belong out here!

196
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:33,205
You're not strong enough.

197
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:34,476
You'll kill yourself.

198
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:42,114
They'll never let you fly.

199
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:44,518
<i>Am I the only one
that's confused here?</i>

200
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,753
You're a decent pilot.

201
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:47,788
But you're too emotional.

202
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,056
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?

203
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,568
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

204
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,671
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

205
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:05,639
And so,

206
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:08,274
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

207
00:16:08,276 --> 00:16:10,610
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

208
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,246
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

209
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,516
Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

210
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,751
<i>Charming memory.</i>

211
00:16:17,753 --> 00:16:19,084
<i>Hang on.</i>

212
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:20,389
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

213
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,626
Goose likes you.

214
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,260
She doesn't typically
take to people.

215
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:29,663
Early start to your morning.

216
00:16:29,665 --> 00:16:31,096
Uh, late night, actually.

217
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:33,165
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.

218
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,099
Sound familiar?

219
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:35,704
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

220
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:38,805
Wonderful view, isn't it?

221
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,040
I prefer the view
from up there.

222
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,342
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

223
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:44,478
<i>Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.</i>

224
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,180
<i>Stand by.</i>

225
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,217
Sound familiar?

226
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,588
Wonderful view, isn't it?

227
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,623
I prefer the view
from up there.

228
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,057
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

229
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,158
<i>What's that
on her shirt?</i>

230
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,362
<i>I couldn't read it.</i>

231
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,665
Wonderful view, isn't it?

232
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,602
I prefer the view
from up there.

233
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:11,203
- <i>Focus.</i>
- Excuse me?

234
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:13,072
<i>Look down.</i>

235
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,107
<i>Focus.</i>

236
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,777
<i>"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.</i>

237
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:18,745
Do you hear that, too?

238
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,382
<i>Do we have
her location?</i>

239
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:24,049
<i>Got it.</i>

240
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:26,455
<i>Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.</i>

241
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,394
<i>Interesting.</i>

242
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:36,496
<i>Huh. Hold on.</i>

243
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:39,301
<i>Go back right before this.
Go back.</i>

244
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:42,869
That's no MiG, Lawson.

245
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:45,505
<i>This is it.
Now let me see where you're headed.</i>

246
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:47,676
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>

247
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,745
<i>Focus.</i>

248
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:53,380
<i>Open, please.</i>

249
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:54,748
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

250
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,815
<i>You're almost there.</i>

251
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:57,686
<i>You're almost there.
Don't fight it.</i>

252
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:00,622
<i>Focus!</i>

253
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:04,125
<i>Get her back!
Get her back now!</i>

254
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,195
This doesn't make any sense.

255
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:29,416
Do we have any information
we can act on?

256
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:32,217
Just that Lawson was
somewhere on planet C-53.

257
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:33,353
We're on our way.

258
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:36,221
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

259
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:39,394
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

260
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:42,096
And everything we're after.

261
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,672
Oh!

262
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,939
That did something.

263
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:54,376
Try that again.

264
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:06,888
Not yet!

265
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,632
What did you do to me?

266
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:20,600
Now we're just after
a little information.

267
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:22,302
What did you put in my head?

268
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:24,205
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

269
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:27,307
But those aren't my memories.

270
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:29,843
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

271
00:19:29,845 --> 00:19:32,345
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

272
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,547
They really did
a number on you.

273
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,715
Enough of your mind games.

274
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,617
What do you want?

275
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,888
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

276
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,657
and her light-speed engine.

277
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:45,525
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

278
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:49,163
Really? Then why is she
in your head?

279
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:21,260
You guys
wouldn't happen to know

280
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,263
how these things come off,
would ya?

281
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:23,897
No?

282
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,299
Fine.

283
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:48,990
Hmm.

284
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:57,959
Hey.

285
00:22:03,398 --> 00:22:04,633
<i>You do
know why they call it a...</i>

286
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:24,884
You leaving so soon?

287
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,421
We're just getting to know
each other.

288
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,807
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

289
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:57,679
Hello? Do you copy?

290
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:29,108
Hi. I'm Vers.
Kree Starforce.

291
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,445
Is this C-53?

292
00:24:32,914 --> 00:24:35,682
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

293
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,951
Yeah. I understand you.

294
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:39,018
Oh, good.

295
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,056
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

296
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,727
Sort of. Uh,
the movie theater has its own guy.

297
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:48,997
Where can I find
communications equipment?

298
00:24:56,104 --> 00:24:57,205
Thank you.

299
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,240
Track the pod.
Find the girl.

300
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,877
She knows more
than she knows.

301
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:39,214
Hey.

302
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,916
This one's taken.

303
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,193
Come on.

304
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:55,362
<i>Vers?</i>

305
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:56,631
Vers?

306
00:25:57,298 --> 00:25:59,299
Verify. CTC-39.

307
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,767
<i>GRXV-1600.</i>

308
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:01,936
<i>And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.</i>

309
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:04,670
<i>Is everyone okay?
What happened?</i>

310
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,639
Skrull ambush.

311
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:08,241
I thought we'd lost you.

312
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:09,376
Did you find Soh-Larr?

313
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:10,877
<i>It wasn't Soh-Larr.</i>

314
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:12,945
<i>Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.</i>

315
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,181
That's impossible.

316
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:17,183
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

317
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:18,751
The Skrulls
messed with my mind.

318
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:19,852
The machine that they used...

319
00:26:19,854 --> 00:26:22,255
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

320
00:26:22,257 --> 00:26:23,390
Vers, where are you?

321
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:25,792
<i>I'm on planet C-53.</i>

322
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,194
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

323
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:29,796
<i>Who?</i>

324
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:33,032
She's who I see.

325
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:34,736
<i>She's what?</i>

326
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:36,738
<i>Vers?</i>

327
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:38,807
Vers, what?

328
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,408
She's a scientist.

329
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,643
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

330
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,244
I have to get to her
before they do...

331
00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:46,946
<i>or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.</i>

332
00:26:46,948 --> 00:26:48,750
No. You've been
caught once already.

333
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:52,118
How far is C-53?

334
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,821
Closest jump point
is 22 hours.

335
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,956
<i>Vers, hold your
position until we get there.</i>

336
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,025
<i>Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.</i>

337
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:00,993
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...

338
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,095
<i>We're sorry.</i>

339
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:03,262
<i>A long-distance
company access code</i>

340
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:03,763
<i>is required for the number
you have dialed.</i>

341
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:05,967
- Yon-Rogg?
- Vers?

342
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:08,502
Vers?

343
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:10,002
<i>Please dial your call
with the access code.</i>

344
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,105
Vers?

345
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:14,941
If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.

346
00:27:14,943 --> 00:27:16,945
She's stronger
than you think.

347
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:19,781
Ever been to C-53?

348
00:27:20,316 --> 00:27:21,383
Once.

349
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:24,351
It's a real shithole.

350
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:37,799
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

351
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,308
Did you call this in?

352
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:02,056
<i>Beacon activated.</i>

353
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:07,026
Excuse me, miss.

354
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:09,463
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

355
00:28:09,465 --> 00:28:12,932
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

356
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:15,437
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.

357
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:18,338
Oh.

358
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,007
Yeah, I think
she went that way.

359
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:24,344
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

360
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:28,848
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

361
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,850
Could I see
some identification, please?

362
00:28:30,852 --> 00:28:32,352
Vers. Kree Starforce.

363
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:33,453
We don't carry
our identification

364
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:34,521
on little cards.

365
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:35,723
Vers?

366
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:38,226
Starforce?

367
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,194
How long you plan
to be in town?

368
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:42,362
oh, I'll be
out of your hair...

369
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:43,829
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls

370
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:45,401
that are infiltrating
your planet.

371
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:47,769
Skrulls?

372
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:49,336
Shapeshifters?

373
00:28:49,338 --> 00:28:52,408
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

374
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:56,075
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?

375
00:28:56,077 --> 00:28:58,978
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

376
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,351
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

377
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:06,320
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

378
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:08,388
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

379
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,491
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.

380
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:13,761
You're under arrest.

381
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:22,804
Rook!

382
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:24,906
Rook, let's roll!

383
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:35,915
Did you see her weapon?

384
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:37,016
I did not.

385
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:48,062
Watch it!

386
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:23,097
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

387
00:30:44,152 --> 00:30:46,954
"Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."

388
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:54,095
"Trust me, true believer."

389
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,209
Get off!

390
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,600
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.

391
00:32:41,637 --> 00:32:43,605
Let's greet them
at the station.

392
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:57,251
<i>Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.</i>

393
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,288
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

394
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,156
And, uh,
where'd everybody go?

395
00:33:04,158 --> 00:33:06,160
<i>I finished
collecting evidence...</i>

396
00:34:34,383 --> 00:34:35,715
We need an ambulance!

397
00:34:35,717 --> 00:34:37,182
Someone call 911!

398
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,718
Hey! You all right?

399
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Oh, my gosh!
Is everyone okay?

400
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:41,688
Anyone else see that?

401
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,425
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.

402
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:35,609
Nice scuba suit.

403
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:42,716
Lighten up, honey, huh?

404
00:35:42,718 --> 00:35:44,586
Got a smile for me?

405
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,124
Freak.

406
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:13,278
All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.

407
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,649
Whatever he runs on,

408
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,216
it's not
on the periodic table.

409
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:19,688
You're saying
he's not from around here?

410
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:21,757
Hey, how's your eye?

411
00:36:22,758 --> 00:36:25,257
Well, I'd say fine...

412
00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:27,562
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

413
00:36:30,264 --> 00:36:35,402
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

414
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:37,437
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

415
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:40,340
And the woman said
that there were more?

416
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:42,409
The word she used
was "infiltration."

417
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,576
You believe her?

418
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,879
Not till I saw this.

419
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:48,948
What's your plan?

420
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,917
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

421
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,319
I got word
on a motorcycle thief

422
00:36:53,321 --> 00:36:55,254
that fits her description.

423
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,991
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

424
00:36:57,993 --> 00:37:00,427
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

425
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,430
Good.

426
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:05,266
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

427
00:37:06,368 --> 00:37:08,501
Not even our own men.

428
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:09,705
Yes, sir.

429
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:27,353
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?

430
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:30,859
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

431
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:38,299
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.

432
00:37:40,035 --> 00:37:42,971
I will finish
what we started.

433
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,648
I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.

434
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,419
No one in or out.

435
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:34,354
Boom!

436
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:00,980
What can I get ya?

437
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:02,551
Where was
this photograph taken?

438
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:04,717
An airport.

439
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,052
Where's Pegasus?

440
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:08,121
That's classified.

441
00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:11,493
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

442
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:15,795
But I see you've changed
it up a bit since then.

443
00:39:15,797 --> 00:39:17,630
Grunge is a good look
for you.

444
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:19,165
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

445
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:20,867
It was cool, you know?

446
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:23,837
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

447
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,874
Got to watch
an alien autopsy.

448
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,609
Typical nine-to-five.

449
00:39:29,611 --> 00:39:30,543
So you saw one?

450
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:33,515
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

451
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:36,716
but I can't unsee that.

452
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:39,419
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.

453
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,788
You think I'm one of
those green things.

454
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,156
Can't be too careful.

455
00:39:43,158 --> 00:39:48,127
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

456
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:49,662
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.

457
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:51,764
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

458
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:53,700
No. The DNA would match.

459
00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:54,901
Want my AOL password?

460
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:56,936
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

461
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:58,940
- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

462
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,041
You wanna get personal.

463
00:40:02,043 --> 00:40:03,943
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

464
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,578
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

465
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,046
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.

466
00:40:07,048 --> 00:40:08,548
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.

467
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,616
Do I pass?

468
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:11,017
Not yet. First job?

469
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:12,886
Soldier. Straight out of
high school.

470
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:14,153
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

471
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:15,521
- Then?
- Spy.

472
00:40:15,523 --> 00:40:16,656
- Where?
- It was the Cold War.

473
00:40:16,658 --> 00:40:17,891
We were everywhere.

474
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:20,760
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

475
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:22,495
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

476
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:23,663
- Now?
- Been riding a desk

477
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:24,764
for the past six years...

478
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:25,865
trying to figure out
where our

479
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:26,933
future enemies
are coming from.

480
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:28,134
Never occurred to me

481
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:30,670
they would be coming
from above.

482
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:32,005
Name a detail so bizarre

483
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:33,441
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

484
00:40:35,777 --> 00:40:39,514
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

485
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:42,949
You didn't need that,
did you?

486
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:44,686
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

487
00:40:45,186 --> 00:40:47,020
Okay. Your turn.

488
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:48,757
Prove you're not a Skrull.

489
00:40:57,232 --> 00:40:59,933
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

490
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:01,234
you're not a Skrull?

491
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:02,637
That's a photon blast.

492
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:04,070
And?

493
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:05,073
A Skrull can't do that.

494
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:07,540
So, a full bird colonel

495
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:08,808
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

496
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,179
must have pretty high
security clearance.

497
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:12,881
Where's Pegasus?

498
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,621
Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

499
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:23,556
to infiltrate
and take over planets.

500
00:41:23,558 --> 00:41:27,727
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

501
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:30,263
Heroes.
Noble warrior heroes.

502
00:41:30,265 --> 00:41:33,935
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

503
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,103
They believe
that she developed

504
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:39,105
a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.

505
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:40,742
Light-speed engine?

506
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,142
Gotta admit, that's not

507
00:41:43,144 --> 00:41:44,711
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

508
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,313
Well, it's still early.

509
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:48,581
And you,
what do you want?

510
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:50,883
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

511
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:51,886
And?

512
00:41:56,024 --> 00:41:59,592
Look, war is
a universal language.

513
00:41:59,594 --> 00:42:02,295
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

514
00:42:02,297 --> 00:42:04,699
You got a personal stake
in this.

515
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:16,609
<i>This is government property.</i>

516
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:18,611
<i>Turn your vehicle around.</i>

517
00:42:18,613 --> 00:42:21,781
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

518
00:42:21,783 --> 00:42:23,918
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>

519
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,853
<i>One moment.</i>

520
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:30,990
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

521
00:42:30,992 --> 00:42:32,725
Everybody calls me Fury.

522
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:36,763
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.

523
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:38,231
- What does your mom call you?
- Fury.

524
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:39,966
- What do you call her?
- Fury.

525
00:42:39,968 --> 00:42:41,134
What about your kids?

526
00:42:41,136 --> 00:42:43,069
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

527
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,304
<i>You are cleared
for access.</i>

528
00:42:44,306 --> 00:42:45,307
Thank you.

529
00:43:15,337 --> 00:43:17,136
Oh, hold up.

530
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:19,874
You look like somebody's
disaffected niece.

531
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:22,877
Put that on.

532
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:26,346
- What is it?
- It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

533
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:29,148
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

534
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,883
help with the covert part
of your job?

535
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:33,088
Said the space soldier who
was wearing a rubber suit.

536
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:35,290
Lose the flannel.

537
00:43:46,368 --> 00:43:48,402
How can I help you?

538
00:43:48,404 --> 00:43:50,605
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

539
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:55,041
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

540
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:57,245
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

541
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,281
Do you know her?

542
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:05,920
Follow me.

543
00:44:06,422 --> 00:44:07,622
Hmm.

544
00:44:10,225 --> 00:44:13,628
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?

545
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,630
No.

546
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:19,100
Well, this ain't it.

547
00:44:26,342 --> 00:44:27,740
Is that a communicator?

548
00:44:27,742 --> 00:44:31,110
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.

549
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:32,312
Who are you paging?

550
00:44:32,314 --> 00:44:36,050
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

551
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:15,888
After you.

552
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,524
Impressive.

553
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:20,295
Oh, you should see what I
can do with a paperclip.

554
00:45:31,005 --> 00:45:33,274
Hey, there. How are you?

555
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:38,144
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

556
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:40,780
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

557
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:43,015
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

558
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:44,150
What's your name?

559
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:47,053
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

560
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:48,056
Fury?

561
00:45:48,324 --> 00:45:49,325
Hmm?

562
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,894
I'll be back.

563
00:45:56,164 --> 00:45:58,432
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

564
00:45:58,434 --> 00:46:00,001
Just let me unravel
this puppy.

565
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,806
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

566
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:07,940
When all you had to do was...

567
00:46:07,942 --> 00:46:09,345
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.

568
00:46:26,428 --> 00:46:28,497
Huh. Lawson.

569
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:41,843
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.

570
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:45,278
I wonder why
they terminated the project.

571
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,784
Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.

572
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:53,389
Kree glyphs?

573
00:46:53,955 --> 00:46:55,023
Hmm?

574
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:57,992
Lawson is not cuckoo.

575
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:02,094
She's Kree.

576
00:47:02,096 --> 00:47:04,598
Well, she's dead.

577
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,265
What?

578
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,067
She crashed
the Asis aircraft

579
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:10,136
doing an unauthorized
test flight.

580
00:47:10,138 --> 00:47:12,238
Took a pilot down
with her.

581
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,508
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.

582
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:17,546
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

583
00:47:19,213 --> 00:47:21,983
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

584
00:47:25,421 --> 00:47:27,021
When did this crash happen?

585
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:30,892
Six years ago. 1989.

586
00:47:32,026 --> 00:47:34,226
Who was the pilot?

587
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:37,497
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...

588
00:47:37,499 --> 00:47:41,967
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

589
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:44,005
Last person
to see them alive.

590
00:47:49,277 --> 00:47:50,412
You okay?

591
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:53,382
Mm-hmm.

592
00:47:55,049 --> 00:47:56,284
Back in a minute.

593
00:48:26,348 --> 00:48:28,582
This isn't about
fighting wars.

594
00:48:28,584 --> 00:48:30,184
It's about ending them.

595
00:48:36,257 --> 00:48:37,990
<i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i>

596
00:48:37,992 --> 00:48:41,060
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

597
00:48:41,062 --> 00:48:43,697
<i>Do you know anything
about this?</i>

598
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:45,432
I just discovered
a mission report

599
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:47,266
sent from C-53.

600
00:48:47,268 --> 00:48:48,368
There's only so much

601
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:51,072
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...

602
00:48:54,676 --> 00:48:59,078
<i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i>

603
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,682
She was working
on a unique energy core.

604
00:49:02,684 --> 00:49:04,183
Experimenting with tech

605
00:49:04,185 --> 00:49:07,054
that apparently could
help us win the war.

606
00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:15,194
She still here?

607
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:17,697
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.

608
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:19,733
- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.

609
00:49:19,735 --> 00:49:21,703
I want to
question her alone.

610
00:49:23,439 --> 00:49:25,674
Excellent work, Nicholas.

611
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:31,445
Does it say anything
about me?

612
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:33,313
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

613
00:49:33,315 --> 00:49:34,246
<i>Why would it?</i>

614
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:37,684
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

615
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,388
<i>On C-53?</i>

616
00:49:41,723 --> 00:49:43,289
Mar-Vell is who I see

617
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:44,724
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.

618
00:49:44,726 --> 00:49:48,194
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

619
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:50,530
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

620
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,499
No, it's not. Because I remember.
I was here.

621
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:54,434
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>

622
00:49:54,436 --> 00:49:56,770
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

623
00:49:56,772 --> 00:50:00,241
<i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i>

624
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,510
She's on sublevel six.

625
00:50:03,512 --> 00:50:05,144
I'll get off on five...

626
00:50:05,146 --> 00:50:08,315
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.

627
00:50:08,317 --> 00:50:11,451
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

628
00:50:11,453 --> 00:50:14,423
Right. Like we did
in Havana.

629
00:50:25,266 --> 00:50:26,366
<i>We're nearing
the jump point.</i>

630
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:28,735
<i>Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.</i>

631
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:31,304
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.

632
00:50:31,306 --> 00:50:33,007
Together.

633
00:50:35,444 --> 00:50:36,712
Okay.

634
00:50:54,463 --> 00:50:56,063
Vers!

635
00:50:57,633 --> 00:50:59,033
Vers!

636
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:17,551
Fury's colluding
with the target.

637
00:51:17,553 --> 00:51:18,885
Then why would he call us in?

638
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:20,453
All I know is
we take him in, too.

639
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:21,588
Dead or alive.

640
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,889
Dead or alive?

641
00:51:37,706 --> 00:51:38,941
Go. Go, go!

642
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,622
Was it something I said?

643
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,674
Mmm-mmm.

644
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:36,763
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...

645
00:52:36,765 --> 00:52:40,769
but they do
kinda complete the look.

646
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:42,704
Don't you think?

647
00:53:00,355 --> 00:53:01,488
You called them in?

648
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,824
My bad.

649
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:19,005
Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?

650
00:53:19,007 --> 00:53:20,742
They're not down here.

651
00:53:22,276 --> 00:53:23,311
Let's try up there.

652
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:33,853
- What?
- Your communicator.

653
00:53:33,855 --> 00:53:35,922
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

654
00:54:06,588 --> 00:54:08,421
Do you know
how to fly this thing?

655
00:54:08,423 --> 00:54:09,556
Uh, we'll see.

656
00:54:09,558 --> 00:54:10,959
That's a yes or no question.

657
00:54:14,996 --> 00:54:15,997
Yes.

658
00:54:19,735 --> 00:54:21,268
That's what I'm talking about!

659
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,731
We got a stowaway.

660
00:54:53,835 --> 00:54:54,903
Hang on, Goose.

661
00:55:00,075 --> 00:55:01,275
Goose.

662
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:05,447
No, Goose.

663
00:55:06,782 --> 00:55:10,416
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

664
00:55:10,418 --> 00:55:12,085
Yes, that's right.

665
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:14,454
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

666
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:15,755
You the good kitty,
that's right.

667
00:55:15,757 --> 00:55:16,892
See anyone you know?

668
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,426
Funny story.

669
00:55:20,428 --> 00:55:23,965
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

670
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:26,065
That was six years ago.

671
00:55:26,067 --> 00:55:28,468
So, you think
you're the pilot

672
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,803
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?

673
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:32,138
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

674
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,473
could probably tell us.

675
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:35,074
- Maria Rambeau?
- Mm-hmm.

676
00:55:35,076 --> 00:55:37,777
So, how do we get
to Louisiana?

677
00:55:37,779 --> 00:55:40,448
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

678
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:43,917
That agent...

679
00:55:43,919 --> 00:55:45,985
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

680
00:55:45,987 --> 00:55:48,054
Coulson. The new guy.

681
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:49,656
I guess
he doesn't hate me yet.

682
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:51,393
Yeah, well, give him time.

683
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:55,061
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?

684
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:57,497
Went with his gut
against orders.

685
00:55:57,499 --> 00:55:58,932
That's a really
hard thing to do.

686
00:55:58,934 --> 00:56:00,967
But it's what
keeps us human.

687
00:56:00,969 --> 00:56:03,603
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

688
00:56:03,605 --> 00:56:04,737
Oh, I can see that about you.

689
00:56:05,874 --> 00:56:10,043
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

690
00:56:10,045 --> 00:56:11,477
I'm guessing that's not

691
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:13,112
standard
Kree operating procedure.

692
00:56:13,114 --> 00:56:15,481
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

693
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:24,757
Ronan.

694
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:26,793
<i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i>

695
00:56:26,795 --> 00:56:28,194
<i>but the greater mission
was a failure,</i>

696
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:29,596
<i>thanks to your team.</i>

697
00:56:29,598 --> 00:56:31,064
It was a trap

698
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:33,900
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

699
00:56:33,902 --> 00:56:35,034
<i>Give us their location.</i>

700
00:56:35,036 --> 00:56:36,903
<i>We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.</i>

701
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:39,839
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

702
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:42,041
No, we'll handle this.

703
00:56:42,043 --> 00:56:44,143
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere</i>

704
00:56:44,145 --> 00:56:46,479
<i>is a threat
to Kree everywhere.</i>

705
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:47,547
<i>Where are they?</i>

706
00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:49,117
- They are...
- Lost.

707
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:52,919
They are lost for now.

708
00:56:52,921 --> 00:56:54,654
But we will find them.

709
00:56:54,656 --> 00:56:58,026
<i>Do so, or we will.</i>

710
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,666
Maintain the course
for C-53.

711
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:26,054
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

712
00:57:28,189 --> 00:57:29,756
Auntie Carol?

713
00:57:29,758 --> 00:57:31,693
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

714
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:35,595
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

715
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:37,666
But we knew they were lying.

716
00:57:39,768 --> 00:57:41,870
I'm not really
who you think I am.

717
00:57:51,046 --> 00:57:53,146
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

718
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:56,282
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

719
00:57:56,284 --> 00:57:57,984
You are
absolutely right, young lady.

720
00:57:57,986 --> 00:57:59,719
There is no such thing.

721
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:01,087
'Cause if there were,

722
00:58:01,089 --> 00:58:03,790
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

723
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:04,859
You don't believe me?

724
00:58:12,867 --> 00:58:14,600
No way!

725
00:58:14,602 --> 00:58:16,669
That's so cool!

726
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:18,104
Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

727
00:58:18,106 --> 00:58:19,539
with those hands.

728
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:20,640
Like what? Show us.

729
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:21,943
Maybe later.

730
00:58:23,144 --> 00:58:24,677
I kept all your stuff.

731
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:26,813
I'll go get it.

732
00:58:26,815 --> 00:58:28,483
You want to give her
a hand with that?

733
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:29,784
Hmm?

734
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,735
You don't remember anything?

735
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:51,539
I see flashes.

736
00:58:52,674 --> 00:58:53,975
Little moments.

737
00:58:54,976 --> 00:58:56,578
But I can't tell
what's real.

738
00:58:58,813 --> 00:59:02,682
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

739
00:59:02,684 --> 00:59:04,919
maybe it'll all
make sense.

740
00:59:07,622 --> 00:59:11,325
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

741
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:13,760
Your usual move.

742
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:16,696
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

743
00:59:16,698 --> 00:59:19,232
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

744
00:59:19,234 --> 00:59:21,934
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

745
00:59:21,936 --> 00:59:23,236
at doing something
that mattered.

746
00:59:23,238 --> 00:59:26,139
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

747
00:59:26,141 --> 00:59:27,073
and I wasn't about to argue,

748
00:59:27,075 --> 00:59:29,175
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

749
00:59:29,177 --> 00:59:31,611
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

750
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:33,179
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

751
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:34,280
Since it violates
the predetermined

752
00:59:34,282 --> 00:59:35,382
rules of engagement.

753
00:59:35,384 --> 00:59:36,849
I definitely
don't remember those.

754
00:59:36,851 --> 00:59:38,651
Hmm. Of course you don't.

755
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:48,861
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

756
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:52,865
She said
she had lives to save.

757
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:54,267
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

758
00:59:54,269 --> 00:59:55,402
but you said that...

759
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:59,205
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

760
00:59:59,207 --> 01:00:04,077
Yeah. Yep.
Big hero moment.

761
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,014
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

762
01:00:08,016 --> 01:00:11,818
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

763
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:16,358
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

764
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:19,892
I know this must be
hard for you.

765
01:00:19,894 --> 01:00:21,830
Oh, what?
This part right here?

766
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:24,966
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

767
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:32,205
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

768
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:33,739
in a mission so secret

769
01:00:33,741 --> 01:00:35,810
they act like it never
even happened.

770
01:00:37,912 --> 01:00:41,348
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

771
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,251
too damn stubborn to die.

772
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:47,454
And now you come up in here
after six years...

773
01:00:47,456 --> 01:00:49,689
with your supercharged
fire hands...

774
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:51,791
and you expect me
to call you...

775
01:00:51,793 --> 01:00:53,329
I don't even know what.
Vers?

776
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,098
Is that really
who you are now?

777
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:01,136
I don't know.

778
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:07,842
Come look!

779
01:01:14,182 --> 01:01:15,982
This is me and you
on Halloween.

780
01:01:15,984 --> 01:01:19,353
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

781
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:21,087
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

782
01:01:21,089 --> 01:01:23,055
You didn't get along
with your parents...

783
01:01:23,057 --> 01:01:24,824
so Mom said
we became your real family.

784
01:01:24,826 --> 01:01:26,393
This is us on Christmas.

785
01:01:26,395 --> 01:01:27,528
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

786
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,463
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

787
01:01:29,465 --> 01:01:30,796
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

788
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:31,864
And this is right after
you graduated.

789
01:01:31,866 --> 01:01:33,099
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

790
01:01:33,101 --> 01:01:35,335
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

791
01:01:35,337 --> 01:01:36,736
And this is you with Mom

792
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:38,004
right after a good day
of training.

793
01:01:38,006 --> 01:01:39,306
These were
your three favorite guys.

794
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:43,042
Oh, wait. I forgot.

795
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:44,744
Your jacket.

796
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:46,078
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

797
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,782
after I spilled
ketchup on it.

798
01:02:01,196 --> 01:02:03,298
That was all
that survived the crash.

799
01:02:04,533 --> 01:02:06,267
Or so we thought.

800
01:02:10,872 --> 01:02:12,905
Don't answer that.

801
01:02:12,907 --> 01:02:14,541
It's just my neighbor.

802
01:02:14,543 --> 01:02:16,277
They can change into anyone.

803
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:23,049
Hi there.

804
01:02:23,051 --> 01:02:24,052
What do you want?

805
01:02:25,421 --> 01:02:27,220
- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.

806
01:02:27,222 --> 01:02:28,888
This is my friend, Carol.

807
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:30,191
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

808
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,560
Yowzers.

809
01:02:33,562 --> 01:02:36,796
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

810
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:39,499
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

811
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:40,833
and I was just wondering...

812
01:02:40,835 --> 01:02:42,001
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

813
01:02:42,003 --> 01:02:43,202
to get a closer look-see?

814
01:02:43,204 --> 01:02:45,539
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

815
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:48,843
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

816
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:50,176
Mmm.

817
01:02:50,178 --> 01:02:51,811
You're really working
overtime

818
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:55,181
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

819
01:02:55,183 --> 01:02:57,984
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

820
01:02:57,986 --> 01:02:59,586
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

821
01:02:59,588 --> 01:03:01,490
- Uh...
- Okay.

822
01:03:03,891 --> 01:03:07,827
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

823
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:09,061
You never know
when you're gonna need

824
01:03:09,063 --> 01:03:10,765
to borrow some sugar.

825
01:03:13,402 --> 01:03:15,602
Now, hang on a second.

826
01:03:15,604 --> 01:03:19,306
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

827
01:03:19,308 --> 01:03:22,277
making a mess
of your friend's house...

828
01:03:23,077 --> 01:03:24,478
It's a lovely home, miss.

829
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,780
Oh, my God!

830
01:03:26,214 --> 01:03:28,147
What the hell?

831
01:03:31,453 --> 01:03:33,021
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

832
01:03:33,555 --> 01:03:36,188
Just don't kill me.

833
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:38,157
That would really complicate
the situation.

834
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,960
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

835
01:03:40,962 --> 01:03:42,329
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

836
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:44,096
I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

837
01:03:44,098 --> 01:03:47,867
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

838
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,135
Without deception.

839
01:03:49,137 --> 01:03:50,339
And who is that out there?

840
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:53,873
Okay, that's a fair point...

841
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:55,475
but I'm sure
that you understand

842
01:03:55,477 --> 01:03:57,910
I had to take
some precautions.

843
01:03:57,912 --> 01:04:01,113
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

844
01:04:01,115 --> 01:04:02,281
with your hands bound.

845
01:04:02,283 --> 01:04:03,517
I just wanna talk.

846
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:04,584
Last time we talked,

847
01:04:04,586 --> 01:04:06,018
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

848
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,522
That was before I knew
who you were.

849
01:04:08,524 --> 01:04:11,826
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

850
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:15,094
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

851
01:04:15,096 --> 01:04:18,130
of your voice
from a plane crash

852
01:04:18,132 --> 01:04:19,599
six years ago...

853
01:04:19,601 --> 01:04:24,404
on a device I believe
you call a "black box."

854
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:27,139
They told me it was
destroyed in the crash.

855
01:04:27,141 --> 01:04:28,342
How'd you get it?

856
01:04:28,344 --> 01:04:29,509
She don't understand.

857
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:31,043
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

858
01:04:31,045 --> 01:04:32,479
that kind of allows me

859
01:04:32,481 --> 01:04:34,648
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

860
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,015
Call me
"young lady" again...

861
01:04:36,017 --> 01:04:37,317
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

862
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:38,853
it's not supposed to be.

863
01:04:40,922 --> 01:04:43,191
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

864
01:04:43,659 --> 01:04:44,725
Your ass.

865
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:47,627
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

866
01:04:47,629 --> 01:04:49,596
But, look,
I just need your help

867
01:04:49,598 --> 01:04:51,097
decoding some coordinates.

868
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:53,099
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

869
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:56,237
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

870
01:04:59,006 --> 01:05:01,175
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

871
01:05:01,677 --> 01:05:02,942
Deal.

872
01:05:04,045 --> 01:05:06,078
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

873
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,414
How'd that get in here?

874
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,517
Hmm?

875
01:05:10,017 --> 01:05:11,117
The cat?

876
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,619
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

877
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:13,921
That's not a cat.

878
01:05:14,956 --> 01:05:17,123
- That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?

879
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,627
Mom?

880
01:05:26,234 --> 01:05:27,367
Monica.

881
01:05:27,369 --> 01:05:29,003
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

882
01:05:56,665 --> 01:05:58,331
What's happening?

883
01:05:58,333 --> 01:05:59,635
It's loading.

884
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:05,171
<i>Punch in the coordinates</i>

885
01:06:05,173 --> 01:06:09,609
<i>5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.</i>

886
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:11,711
<i>Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?</i>

887
01:06:11,713 --> 01:06:13,346
<i>My laboratory.</i>

888
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:15,649
<i>Your laboratory?
What do you mean?</i>

889
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:16,683
<i>Oh, no.</i>

890
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:19,151
<i>Is that...
Wait, what is that?</i>

891
01:06:19,153 --> 01:06:20,620
<i>It's not showing up
on my radar.</i>

892
01:06:20,622 --> 01:06:22,522
<i>Go, Carol. Fly!</i>

893
01:06:22,524 --> 01:06:25,057
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

894
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:27,126
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

895
01:06:27,128 --> 01:06:28,129
Yes, ma'am.

896
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:36,470
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

897
01:06:36,472 --> 01:06:38,072
I never should have
brought you along.

898
01:06:43,244 --> 01:06:44,245
Here come some G's.

899
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:05,467
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

900
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:18,212
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

901
01:07:22,149 --> 01:07:23,251
Stay with me, Lawson!

902
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:42,869
<i>Carol, come in. Do you copy?</i>

903
01:07:42,871 --> 01:07:45,539
Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

904
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:47,307
<i>Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?</i>

905
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:49,444
Yeah! I copy.

906
01:07:52,246 --> 01:07:53,247
Doc?

907
01:07:54,248 --> 01:07:55,617
Your blood.

908
01:07:56,451 --> 01:07:58,351
It's blue.

909
01:07:58,353 --> 01:08:01,490
Yeah, but, uh,
how's my hair?

910
01:08:02,858 --> 01:08:05,360
Help me out, will ya?

911
01:08:08,397 --> 01:08:11,565
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

912
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:13,165
Lawson?

913
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:15,669
You remember what I said about
our work here?

914
01:08:15,671 --> 01:08:16,772
What it's for?

915
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:19,306
To end wars?

916
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:22,811
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

917
01:08:24,178 --> 01:08:25,547
Damn it!

918
01:08:26,247 --> 01:08:28,582
My name is not Lawson.

919
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:31,685
My real name is Mar-Vell,

920
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:34,621
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

921
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:38,190
I would say
that you're delusional...

922
01:08:38,192 --> 01:08:39,726
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

923
01:08:39,728 --> 01:08:42,227
and your blood is blue.

924
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:46,231
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

925
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:48,167
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

926
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:49,469
any more regrets.

927
01:08:49,471 --> 01:08:52,204
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

928
01:08:52,206 --> 01:08:53,807
You gotta save 'em without me.

929
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:54,808
Save who? How?

930
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:58,210
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

931
01:08:58,212 --> 01:08:59,448
What are you doing?

932
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:21,470
We have no interest
in hurting you.

933
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:23,036
No?

934
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:25,907
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

935
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:28,910
The energy core.

936
01:09:29,778 --> 01:09:31,311
Where is it?

937
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:33,747
Pararescue's on the way.

938
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:35,915
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

939
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:38,752
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

940
01:09:38,754 --> 01:09:39,788
No, wait!

941
01:09:46,328 --> 01:09:47,629
You mean that energy core?

942
01:09:52,266 --> 01:09:53,368
No!

943
01:10:36,878 --> 01:10:40,513
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

944
01:10:40,515 --> 01:10:41,516
Hold your fire.

945
01:10:51,526 --> 01:10:53,560
There's nothing left.

946
01:10:53,562 --> 01:10:55,296
The core has been destroyed.

947
01:11:04,773 --> 01:11:06,775
She absorbed its power.

948
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:10,812
She's coming with us.

949
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,001
He lied to me.

950
01:11:35,704 --> 01:11:37,804
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

951
01:11:37,806 --> 01:11:40,540
Now, you understand.

952
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:43,076
What?
What do I understand now?

953
01:11:43,078 --> 01:11:45,111
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

954
01:11:45,113 --> 01:11:46,414
He killed her...

955
01:11:47,115 --> 01:11:49,015
'cause she found out
that she was

956
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:52,452
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

957
01:11:52,454 --> 01:11:53,953
No.

958
01:11:53,955 --> 01:11:56,389
Your people are terrorists.

959
01:11:56,391 --> 01:11:57,924
They kill innocents.

960
01:11:57,926 --> 01:11:59,859
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

961
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:03,563
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

962
01:12:03,565 --> 01:12:07,634
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

963
01:12:07,636 --> 01:12:10,737
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

964
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:12,872
and they destroyed
our planet.

965
01:12:12,874 --> 01:12:16,609
And the handful of us
that are left

966
01:12:16,611 --> 01:12:18,778
will be slaughtered next...

967
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,784
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

968
01:12:24,019 --> 01:12:25,618
The core that she found

969
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,387
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

970
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:29,155
capable of carrying us
to safety.

971
01:12:29,157 --> 01:12:33,328
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

972
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:37,063
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

973
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:38,598
wasn't to fight wars...

974
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,099
but to end them.

975
01:12:40,101 --> 01:12:45,740
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

976
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:47,907
Well, I already destroyed it.

977
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:49,676
No, you destroyed
the engine.

978
01:12:49,678 --> 01:12:52,812
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

979
01:12:52,814 --> 01:12:57,183
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

980
01:12:57,185 --> 01:12:58,820
we can find it.

981
01:13:00,655 --> 01:13:02,357
You'll use it
to destroy us.

982
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:07,562
We just want a home.

983
01:13:11,766 --> 01:13:17,070
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

984
01:13:17,072 --> 01:13:19,072
Can't you see it now?

985
01:13:19,074 --> 01:13:20,575
You're not one of them.

986
01:13:23,612 --> 01:13:25,013
You don't know me.

987
01:13:26,514 --> 01:13:28,884
You have no idea
who I am.

988
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:33,388
I don't even know
who I am!

989
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:36,858
You are Carol Danvers.

990
01:13:38,059 --> 01:13:40,226
You are the woman
on that black box

991
01:13:40,228 --> 01:13:42,864
risking her life
to do the right thing.

992
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:46,633
My best friend...

993
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:49,636
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

994
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:51,704
when no one else did.

995
01:13:51,706 --> 01:13:56,910
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

996
01:13:56,912 --> 01:14:00,246
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

997
01:14:00,248 --> 01:14:03,518
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

998
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:05,654
You hear me?

999
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:08,823
Do you hear me?

1000
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:18,033
Come here. Come here, girl.

1001
01:14:18,767 --> 01:14:20,101
I got you.

1002
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:27,707
<i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1003
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:29,943
but you were our only lead.

1004
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:32,211
We discovered
that your energy signature

1005
01:14:32,213 --> 01:14:35,016
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1006
01:14:35,884 --> 01:14:37,752
Now we know why.

1007
01:14:39,621 --> 01:14:43,591
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1008
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:46,526
I just need your help

1009
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:50,730
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1010
01:14:50,732 --> 01:14:53,900
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1011
01:14:53,902 --> 01:14:55,969
For orbital position
and velocity.

1012
01:14:55,971 --> 01:14:57,804
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1013
01:14:57,806 --> 01:14:59,138
'cause it's not on Earth.

1014
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,073
That was the location

1015
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:01,674
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1016
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:03,042
If we track its course,

1017
01:15:03,044 --> 01:15:05,611
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1018
01:15:05,613 --> 01:15:07,182
It's just basic physics.

1019
01:15:09,751 --> 01:15:10,552
In orbit?

1020
01:15:12,687 --> 01:15:14,287
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1021
01:15:14,289 --> 01:15:17,223
I mean, you're
my science guy, right?

1022
01:15:17,225 --> 01:15:19,959
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1023
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:22,795
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1024
01:15:22,797 --> 01:15:24,664
Mmm. We're going
to space?

1025
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:25,732
In what?

1026
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:27,633
A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1027
01:15:27,635 --> 01:15:29,869
I can handle
the modifications.

1028
01:15:29,871 --> 01:15:31,606
Mmm. Your science guy.

1029
01:15:38,347 --> 01:15:39,981
Well, I could use
a copilot.

1030
01:15:41,249 --> 01:15:43,916
No. No, I can't.

1031
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:45,952
I can't leave Monica.

1032
01:15:45,954 --> 01:15:49,255
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1033
01:15:49,257 --> 01:15:51,624
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1034
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:53,693
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1035
01:15:53,695 --> 01:15:54,729
and you used to do that.

1036
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:58,332
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1037
01:15:58,334 --> 01:15:59,999
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1038
01:16:00,001 --> 01:16:01,834
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1039
01:16:01,836 --> 01:16:02,935
with
a technologically-superior

1040
01:16:02,937 --> 01:16:03,938
foreign enemy.

1041
01:16:04,373 --> 01:16:05,938
Correct?

1042
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,006
That's what I'm saying.

1043
01:16:07,008 --> 01:16:08,274
- You have to go!
- Monica!

1044
01:16:08,276 --> 01:16:09,675
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1045
01:16:09,677 --> 01:16:10,910
in the history
of missions...

1046
01:16:10,912 --> 01:16:12,779
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1047
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:13,982
and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i>
with me?

1048
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:15,882
What?

1049
01:16:15,884 --> 01:16:17,083
I just think
you should consider...

1050
01:16:17,085 --> 01:16:20,322
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1051
01:16:27,996 --> 01:16:29,396
What's going on around here?

1052
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:30,663
I know, I know.

1053
01:16:30,665 --> 01:16:32,067
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1054
01:16:37,072 --> 01:16:39,406
Your mom's lucky.

1055
01:16:39,408 --> 01:16:40,907
When they were
handing out kids,

1056
01:16:40,909 --> 01:16:43,109
they gave her
the toughest one.

1057
01:16:43,111 --> 01:16:44,112
Lieutenant Trouble.

1058
01:16:45,113 --> 01:16:46,748
You remembered.

1059
01:16:48,116 --> 01:16:49,584
Is that mine?

1060
01:16:50,285 --> 01:16:52,419
No, no.

1061
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:55,288
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1062
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:57,990
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1063
01:16:57,992 --> 01:17:00,860
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1064
01:17:00,862 --> 01:17:03,930
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1065
01:17:03,932 --> 01:17:05,800
with any sense of style...

1066
01:17:07,035 --> 01:17:08,103
Hmm?

1067
01:17:10,205 --> 01:17:11,239
Whoa.

1068
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:15,043
No.

1069
01:17:17,313 --> 01:17:18,314
Uh-uh.

1070
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:21,415
Definitely not.

1071
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,821
Well, since we're
on the same team...

1072
01:17:37,899 --> 01:17:39,033
Hmm.

1073
01:17:40,336 --> 01:17:42,003
How do I look?

1074
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:46,875
Fresh.

1075
01:18:06,794 --> 01:18:08,861
What took you so long?

1076
01:18:08,863 --> 01:18:11,831
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

1077
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:14,267
- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.

1078
01:18:14,269 --> 01:18:16,037
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1079
01:18:17,071 --> 01:18:19,406
Okay, then let's do this.

1080
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:22,875
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1081
01:18:22,877 --> 01:18:25,778
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1082
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:26,948
But you would never
tell me who.

1083
01:18:28,384 --> 01:18:31,784
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

1084
01:18:31,786 --> 01:18:33,320
The transfusion.

1085
01:18:33,322 --> 01:18:35,522
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1086
01:18:35,524 --> 01:18:36,724
Whose blood?

1087
01:18:39,328 --> 01:18:40,362
Hmm.

1088
01:18:47,835 --> 01:18:51,873
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1089
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:58,010
What have you done with her?

1090
01:18:58,012 --> 01:18:59,981
You're too late.

1091
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:17,499
She knows?

1092
01:19:32,247 --> 01:19:35,815
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

1093
01:19:35,817 --> 01:19:36,949
Come at once.

1094
01:19:36,951 --> 01:19:39,185
<i>For the good of all Kree,
Commander...</i>

1095
01:19:39,187 --> 01:19:42,221
<i>the infestation
will be eradicated.</i>

1096
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:46,027
Passing 500 and climbing.

1097
01:19:49,197 --> 01:19:52,466
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1098
01:19:52,468 --> 01:19:55,935
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1099
01:19:55,937 --> 01:19:58,838
And as long as he continues
to freak you out...

1100
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,106
like that...

1101
01:20:00,108 --> 01:20:02,509
yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him

1102
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:05,512
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1103
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:07,314
Can I ask you something?

1104
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:09,516
Do you just turn into
anything you want?

1105
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:11,385
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1106
01:20:11,387 --> 01:20:13,019
Can you all do it?

1107
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:14,954
Physiologically? Yeah.

1108
01:20:14,956 --> 01:20:17,223
But, uh, it takes practice...

1109
01:20:17,225 --> 01:20:21,160
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

1110
01:20:21,162 --> 01:20:23,863
- Can you turn into a cat?
- What's a cat?

1111
01:20:23,865 --> 01:20:25,399
What about a filing cabinet?

1112
01:20:25,401 --> 01:20:28,468
Why would I turn into
a filing cabinet?

1113
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:29,869
A Venus flytrap?

1114
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:30,936
I'll give you
50 bucks right now

1115
01:20:30,938 --> 01:20:32,171
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

1116
01:20:32,173 --> 01:20:33,973
Switching engines

1117
01:20:33,975 --> 01:20:36,210
from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

1118
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:46,285
Hey.

1119
01:20:46,287 --> 01:20:49,155
Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?

1120
01:20:49,157 --> 01:20:50,158
Pretty much.

1121
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:25,960
Locking in
on coordinate grid.

1122
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:27,596
Where is it?

1123
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,133
It's here.
It's gotta be here.

1124
01:21:34,135 --> 01:21:39,341
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

1125
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:47,046
<i>Decloaking activated.</i>

1126
01:22:50,044 --> 01:22:51,745
Is that it? The core?

1127
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:54,182
In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.

1128
01:23:00,288 --> 01:23:01,356
Whoa.

1129
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:05,193
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

1130
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,239
We're not alone.

1131
01:23:43,297 --> 01:23:44,566
Talos!

1132
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:57,412
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

1133
01:24:19,868 --> 01:24:21,235
It's okay.

1134
01:24:26,207 --> 01:24:27,841
We didn't know what to do.

1135
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:31,411
Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1136
01:24:31,413 --> 01:24:33,178
or the Kree would find us.

1137
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:35,283
You did the right thing.

1138
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,593
It's okay, it's okay.

1139
01:24:46,595 --> 01:24:48,664
She's all right.
She's a friend.

1140
01:24:50,699 --> 01:24:52,632
I am not gonna hurt you.

1141
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:54,536
She led me to you.

1142
01:24:55,337 --> 01:24:56,738
I'm so sorry.

1143
01:24:58,507 --> 01:24:59,839
I didn't know.

1144
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:01,075
Carol.

1145
01:25:01,743 --> 01:25:04,578
This is war.

1146
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:08,082
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

1147
01:25:08,717 --> 01:25:10,850
But we're here now.

1148
01:25:10,852 --> 01:25:14,088
You found my family.

1149
01:25:16,925 --> 01:25:18,892
This is just the beginning.

1150
01:25:18,894 --> 01:25:21,797
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1151
01:25:22,898 --> 01:25:25,667
scattered throughout
the galaxy.

1152
01:25:43,485 --> 01:25:45,785
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

1153
01:25:45,787 --> 01:25:47,787
I'd have
some high scores, too.

1154
01:25:50,425 --> 01:25:52,726
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1155
01:25:52,728 --> 01:25:53,829
Uh-uh.

1156
01:26:05,907 --> 01:26:08,207
What did you do
to your uniform?

1157
01:26:08,209 --> 01:26:10,343
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1158
01:26:10,345 --> 01:26:12,211
The Supreme Intelligence
will set her straight.

1159
01:26:12,213 --> 01:26:13,680
You can see
they're not soldiers.

1160
01:26:13,682 --> 01:26:16,248
Let 'em go.
You can have me.

1161
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,784
And the core?

1162
01:26:17,786 --> 01:26:19,386
You lied to me.

1163
01:26:19,388 --> 01:26:23,390
I made you
the best version of yourself.

1164
01:26:26,695 --> 01:26:29,696
What's given
can be taken away.

1165
01:26:43,512 --> 01:26:44,611
Back here! Move, move!

1166
01:26:44,613 --> 01:26:47,181
Get over here. Get down!

1167
01:26:47,683 --> 01:26:50,352
Let's go! Go, move!

1168
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:31,424
There she is.

1169
01:27:31,426 --> 01:27:34,863
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1170
01:27:35,764 --> 01:27:37,630
This jacket.

1171
01:27:37,632 --> 01:27:39,634
It's killer,
by the way.

1172
01:27:41,036 --> 01:27:42,635
Oh.

1173
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:44,871
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1174
01:27:44,873 --> 01:27:46,706
Let me out.

1175
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:48,641
No can do.

1176
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:52,545
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1177
01:27:52,547 --> 01:27:54,481
With what exactly?

1178
01:27:54,483 --> 01:27:55,882
Your power comes from us.

1179
01:27:55,884 --> 01:27:57,817
You didn't give me
these powers.

1180
01:27:57,819 --> 01:27:58,985
The blast did.

1181
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:00,453
And yet, you've never had
the strength

1182
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:01,556
to control them
on your own.

1183
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:14,667
<i>Species: Flerken.</i>

1184
01:28:14,669 --> 01:28:16,669
<i>Threat: high.</i>

1185
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:23,512
It's a cat,
not Hannibal Lecter.

1186
01:28:27,048 --> 01:28:28,748
<i>Species: human male.</i>

1187
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,952
<i>Threat: low to none.</i>

1188
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:33,653
That thing's
clearly busted.

1189
01:28:33,655 --> 01:28:35,757
Load the Flerken
onto the <i>Helion.</i>

1190
01:28:36,591 --> 01:28:38,560
Eject the others into space.

1191
01:28:41,463 --> 01:28:43,498
You did good, Ace.

1192
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,132
Thanks to you...

1193
01:28:46,134 --> 01:28:48,368
those insidious shapeshifters

1194
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:49,936
will threaten
our borders no more.

1195
01:28:49,938 --> 01:28:52,472
I used to believe
your lies...

1196
01:28:52,474 --> 01:28:55,108
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

1197
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:56,810
You're talking
about destroying them

1198
01:28:56,812 --> 01:28:58,645
because they won't submit
to your rule.

1199
01:28:58,647 --> 01:28:59,846
And neither will I.

1200
01:28:59,848 --> 01:29:03,149
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1201
01:29:03,151 --> 01:29:04,818
You stole me.

1202
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:07,654
From my home,
my family, my friends.

1203
01:29:15,664 --> 01:29:17,566
It's cute how hard you try.

1204
01:29:19,668 --> 01:29:21,403
But remember...

1205
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:23,970
without us...

1206
01:29:23,972 --> 01:29:25,040
<i>Give it up, Carol.</i>

1207
01:29:26,808 --> 01:29:28,107
<i>Stay down!</i>

1208
01:29:28,109 --> 01:29:29,776
...you're weak.

1209
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:31,711
<i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>

1210
01:29:31,713 --> 01:29:33,112
You're flawed.

1211
01:29:33,114 --> 01:29:34,482
<i>Are you trying
to kill yourself?</i>

1212
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:36,516
Helpless.

1213
01:29:36,518 --> 01:29:37,584
<i>You're too emotional
and so weak.</i>

1214
01:29:37,586 --> 01:29:39,986
<i>You don't belong out here!</i>

1215
01:29:39,988 --> 01:29:41,688
We saved you.

1216
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:43,156
- <i>Control it.</i>
- <i>I told you,</i>

1217
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:44,224
- <i>Carol.</i>
- <i>They'll never</i>

1218
01:29:44,226 --> 01:29:45,491
- <i>let you fly.</i>
- <i>This ain't</i>

1219
01:29:45,493 --> 01:29:46,559
- <i>a game for little girls.</i>
- <i>You kiss like a horse.</i>

1220
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:47,729
<i>You won't last
a week, Danvers.</i>

1221
01:29:50,799 --> 01:29:53,869
Without us,
you're only human.

1222
01:29:55,437 --> 01:29:56,638
You're right.

1223
01:29:57,839 --> 01:29:59,941
I'm only human.

1224
01:30:33,909 --> 01:30:37,510
On Hala,
you were reborn...

1225
01:30:37,512 --> 01:30:38,813
Vers.

1226
01:30:43,818 --> 01:30:46,755
My name is Carol.

1227
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:03,038
She's trying to break out.

1228
01:31:47,282 --> 01:31:50,752
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1229
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,252
But what happens when...

1230
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:58,526
I'm finally set free?

1231
01:32:38,933 --> 01:32:41,701
You know you're glowing,
right?

1232
01:32:41,703 --> 01:32:42,704
I'll explain it later.

1233
01:32:45,273 --> 01:32:46,739
Take the Tesseract.

1234
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:47,974
Leave the lunchbox.

1235
01:32:47,976 --> 01:32:49,709
- Me?
- Yes.

1236
01:32:49,711 --> 01:32:51,110
I'm not touching that thing.

1237
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:52,180
You want me to
get you an oven mitt?

1238
01:32:58,053 --> 01:32:59,220
Whoa!

1239
01:33:05,927 --> 01:33:08,661
Get the Skrulls
on the Quadjet and go.

1240
01:33:08,663 --> 01:33:11,331
Take the Flerken with you.

1241
01:33:11,333 --> 01:33:13,101
- What about you?
- I'll buy you some time!

1242
01:33:15,036 --> 01:33:16,905
I'm picking you up now.

1243
01:33:20,008 --> 01:33:22,610
I'm trusting you
not to eat me.

1244
01:33:27,782 --> 01:33:28,783
Oh, hey, guys.

1245
01:33:32,687 --> 01:33:34,222
Arm wrestle
for the Tesseract?

1246
01:33:37,326 --> 01:33:39,992
I used to find you amusing.

1247
01:33:39,994 --> 01:33:40,995
Let's put an end to this.

1248
01:34:16,365 --> 01:34:17,333
Okay.

1249
01:34:17,899 --> 01:34:19,132
Good kitty.

1250
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:07,282
You knew all along.

1251
01:35:08,384 --> 01:35:09,815
Is that why
we never hung out?

1252
01:35:09,817 --> 01:35:10,919
No, I just never
liked you.

1253
01:35:18,126 --> 01:35:19,127
Incoming!

1254
01:35:27,536 --> 01:35:28,736
Hey, in a hurry?

1255
01:35:30,939 --> 01:35:32,939
Don't make me do this.

1256
01:35:32,941 --> 01:35:33,942
Okay.

1257
01:35:49,824 --> 01:35:50,825
Come on, do your thing!

1258
01:35:51,993 --> 01:35:53,061
Come on!

1259
01:35:55,331 --> 01:35:56,929
Come on!

1260
01:35:59,968 --> 01:36:01,335
Damn it, Goose.

1261
01:36:01,337 --> 01:36:02,438
Pick a side.

1262
01:36:06,808 --> 01:36:08,841
Take them
to the hangar, too.

1263
01:36:08,843 --> 01:36:10,544
We'll blast them all
into space.

1264
01:36:12,548 --> 01:36:13,748
Play it cool.

1265
01:36:15,149 --> 01:36:16,418
Just like Havana.

1266
01:36:18,253 --> 01:36:20,487
Do you have the thing?

1267
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:22,123
Flerken kitty ate it.

1268
01:36:35,437 --> 01:36:37,069
Come on, move!

1269
01:36:37,071 --> 01:36:38,206
Move!

1270
01:36:38,873 --> 01:36:40,108
Follow my lead.

1271
01:36:44,112 --> 01:36:45,113
Cover her eyes.

1272
01:36:53,522 --> 01:36:55,288
Onto the ship!

1273
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:57,058
Let's go! Let's go!

1274
01:37:19,947 --> 01:37:22,248
Nice diversion.

1275
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,052
I could have swore
I put it in there.

1276
01:38:21,075 --> 01:38:23,275
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1277
01:38:23,277 --> 01:38:24,346
On it.

1278
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,184
You all right, friend?

1279
01:38:31,252 --> 01:38:33,187
Never better.

1280
01:38:38,025 --> 01:38:39,661
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1281
01:40:19,595 --> 01:40:21,295
Yes! Boom!

1282
01:40:37,312 --> 01:40:38,480
Whoo!

1283
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:43,217
What the hell was that?

1284
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:08,644
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1285
01:42:00,862 --> 01:42:02,529
That's impossible.

1286
01:42:02,531 --> 01:42:04,898
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

1287
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:07,603
advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.

1288
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:11,573
That's not
their defense system, Ronan.

1289
01:42:15,944 --> 01:42:17,278
Take her down.

1290
01:42:37,231 --> 01:42:38,265
Whoo!

1291
01:43:27,749 --> 01:43:29,685
Return to the jump point.

1292
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,821
We'll be back
for the weapon.

1293
01:43:34,456 --> 01:43:35,624
The core?

1294
01:43:37,492 --> 01:43:38,727
The woman.

1295
01:44:26,842 --> 01:44:28,410
I'm so proud of you.

1296
01:44:30,412 --> 01:44:31,778
You've come a long way

1297
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:34,380
since I found you
that day by the lake.

1298
01:44:34,382 --> 01:44:36,549
But can you keep
your emotions in check

1299
01:44:36,551 --> 01:44:38,852
long enough to take me on?

1300
01:44:38,854 --> 01:44:41,590
Or will they get the
better of you as always?

1301
01:44:43,024 --> 01:44:44,891
I always told you...

1302
01:44:44,893 --> 01:44:46,392
you'll be ready

1303
01:44:46,394 --> 01:44:48,795
the day you can knock
me down as yourself.

1304
01:44:48,797 --> 01:44:50,497
This is that moment.

1305
01:44:50,499 --> 01:44:53,032
This is that moment, Vers!

1306
01:44:53,034 --> 01:44:54,434
Turn off the light show...

1307
01:44:54,436 --> 01:44:57,706
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1308
01:45:13,121 --> 01:45:15,323
I have nothing
to prove to you.

1309
01:45:31,006 --> 01:45:33,373
<i>Destination: Hala.</i>

1310
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:35,008
I can't go back empty-handed.

1311
01:45:35,010 --> 01:45:36,943
You won't be empty-handed.

1312
01:45:36,945 --> 01:45:39,512
I'm sending you
with a message.

1313
01:45:39,514 --> 01:45:42,782
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1314
01:45:42,784 --> 01:45:45,587
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1315
01:45:47,489 --> 01:45:48,790
You can't do this.

1316
01:46:07,709 --> 01:46:11,444
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

1317
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:13,880
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

1318
01:46:13,882 --> 01:46:15,014
Ow!

1319
01:46:15,016 --> 01:46:16,549
Mother Flerken!

1320
01:46:16,551 --> 01:46:17,984
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1321
01:46:17,986 --> 01:46:19,621
It's just a scratch.

1322
01:46:19,921 --> 01:46:21,356
No.

1323
01:46:28,797 --> 01:46:30,730
I can't believe

1324
01:46:30,732 --> 01:46:32,131
you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...

1325
01:46:32,133 --> 01:46:33,766
and I missed it.

1326
01:46:33,768 --> 01:46:35,568
I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1327
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:37,737
Some nifty flying
you did out there.

1328
01:46:37,739 --> 01:46:39,873
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1329
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:41,774
I'll consider it...

1330
01:46:41,776 --> 01:46:44,911
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1331
01:46:44,913 --> 01:46:46,112
How's your eye?

1332
01:46:46,114 --> 01:46:48,548
Hmm. Getting better
every second.

1333
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:49,849
Just so I'm clear...

1334
01:46:49,851 --> 01:46:51,484
you were Soh-Larr...

1335
01:46:51,486 --> 01:46:53,920
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
- Keller.

1336
01:46:53,922 --> 01:46:56,522
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

1337
01:46:56,524 --> 01:46:59,525
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1338
01:46:59,527 --> 01:47:00,860
It is a little like stealing.

1339
01:47:00,862 --> 01:47:02,595
Whose side are you on here?

1340
01:47:02,597 --> 01:47:04,097
You're good to go here
until you recover...

1341
01:47:04,099 --> 01:47:07,467
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1342
01:47:07,469 --> 01:47:09,068
I could go back
to being your boss.

1343
01:47:09,070 --> 01:47:10,169
Uh, please don't.

1344
01:47:10,171 --> 01:47:13,206
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1345
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:15,842
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1346
01:47:15,844 --> 01:47:17,877
Don't ever change
your eyes.

1347
01:47:17,879 --> 01:47:19,512
She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1348
01:47:19,514 --> 01:47:21,180
I was trying
not to panic...

1349
01:47:21,182 --> 01:47:22,751
I'll help you find a home.

1350
01:47:23,818 --> 01:47:24,920
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1351
01:47:26,988 --> 01:47:29,489
They can stay here
with us.

1352
01:47:29,491 --> 01:47:31,057
Can't they, Mom?

1353
01:47:31,059 --> 01:47:33,693
They won't
be safe here, baby.

1354
01:47:33,695 --> 01:47:35,261
Auntie Carol's right.

1355
01:47:35,263 --> 01:47:36,464
They need their own home.

1356
01:47:37,632 --> 01:47:39,832
I'll be back
before you know it.

1357
01:47:39,834 --> 01:47:43,202
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1358
01:47:43,204 --> 01:47:46,172
Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1359
01:47:46,174 --> 01:47:47,740
Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.

1360
01:47:47,742 --> 01:47:49,544
- You don't know.
- He doesn't.

1361
01:47:59,154 --> 01:48:01,690
Keep the Tesseract
on Earth.

1362
01:48:02,257 --> 01:48:03,589
Hidden.

1363
01:48:03,591 --> 01:48:05,627
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1364
01:48:06,161 --> 01:48:07,560
Mar-Vell.

1365
01:48:07,562 --> 01:48:08,928
That's what I said.

1366
01:48:08,930 --> 01:48:11,531
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1367
01:48:11,533 --> 01:48:12,932
Mar-Vell.

1368
01:48:12,934 --> 01:48:14,067
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1369
01:48:14,069 --> 01:48:15,503
You know,
like the Marvelettes.

1370
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:30,216
Not ringing any bells?

1371
01:48:30,218 --> 01:48:32,253
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1372
01:48:47,736 --> 01:48:49,836
I upgraded it.

1373
01:48:49,838 --> 01:48:52,207
Range should be a couple
galaxies, at least.

1374
01:48:54,909 --> 01:48:57,210
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1375
01:48:57,212 --> 01:49:00,849
For emergencies only, okay?

1376
01:49:05,354 --> 01:49:08,221
Well...

1377
01:49:08,223 --> 01:49:10,757
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1378
01:49:10,759 --> 01:49:12,794
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1379
01:49:14,963 --> 01:49:16,831
Oh!

1380
01:49:29,611 --> 01:49:31,646
We got
the ketchup stain off.

1381
01:49:36,985 --> 01:49:38,820
Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.

1382
01:49:40,822 --> 01:49:41,990
Hmm.

1383
01:49:48,063 --> 01:49:50,797
It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.

1384
01:50:04,279 --> 01:50:05,613
Go on.

1385
01:51:12,481 --> 01:51:15,283
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1386
01:51:20,221 --> 01:51:21,390
So, is it true?

1387
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:23,990
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1388
01:51:23,992 --> 01:51:27,260
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1389
01:51:27,262 --> 01:51:31,197
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1390
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:32,267
Understood.

1391
01:51:33,902 --> 01:51:34,867
I'm sorry to report

1392
01:51:34,869 --> 01:51:36,102
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

1393
01:51:36,104 --> 01:51:38,338
I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.

1394
01:51:39,974 --> 01:51:41,874
I'll let you know
when it does.

1395
01:51:41,876 --> 01:51:43,178
Then what?

1396
01:51:43,811 --> 01:51:45,111
Sir?

1397
01:51:45,113 --> 01:51:46,078
We have no idea

1398
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:49,449
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

1399
01:51:49,451 --> 01:51:51,518
And our one-woman
security force

1400
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,052
had a prior commitment...

1401
01:51:53,054 --> 01:51:54,856
on the other side
of the universe.

1402
01:51:57,526 --> 01:51:59,761
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.

1403
01:52:01,363 --> 01:52:03,229
We need to find more.

1404
01:52:03,231 --> 01:52:04,364
More weapons?

1405
01:52:04,366 --> 01:52:06,265
More heroes.

1406
01:52:06,267 --> 01:52:07,967
You think you can find
others like her?

1407
01:52:07,969 --> 01:52:10,972
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1408
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:13,274
Get some rest, sir.

1409
01:52:14,343 --> 01:52:16,211
You got
a big decision to make.

1410
01:55:15,357 --> 01:55:17,091
This is a nightmare.

1411
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:21,028
I've had better nightmares.

1412
01:55:23,164 --> 01:55:24,198
Hey.

1413
01:55:25,266 --> 01:55:27,401
So, that thing just stopped

1414
01:55:27,403 --> 01:55:29,170
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

1415
01:55:31,105 --> 01:55:33,673
What do we got?

1416
01:55:33,675 --> 01:55:36,275
Whatever signal it was
sending finally crapped out.

1417
01:55:36,277 --> 01:55:37,377
I thought
we bypassed the battery.

1418
01:55:37,379 --> 01:55:38,512
We did.

1419
01:55:38,514 --> 01:55:42,315
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

1420
01:55:42,317 --> 01:55:44,250
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1421
01:55:44,252 --> 01:55:45,719
We don't even know
what this is.

1422
01:55:45,721 --> 01:55:48,455
Fury did.
Just do it, please.

1423
01:55:48,457 --> 01:55:51,190
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

1424
01:55:51,192 --> 01:55:53,595
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

1425
01:55:56,532 --> 01:55:58,065
Where's Fury?

1426
