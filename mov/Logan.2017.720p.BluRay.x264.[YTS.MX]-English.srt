1
00:00:58,107 --> 00:00:59,843
<i>We get the wheels,
we get la feria,</i>

2
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:01,709
<i>we keep moving on.
No messing around.</i>

3
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,020
<i>You mess those
wheels up this time,</i>

4
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,112
<i>Chong,
I'm gonna have your ass.</i>

5
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:05,113
<i>Move!</i>

6
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:07,909
<i>- Right there, homes.
- There's nobody, homes.</i>

7
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:09,117
<i>Where's your party, boy?</i>

8
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,684
<i>Turn down the radio.</i>

9
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:12,326
<i>You inviting the cops,
too, or what?</i>

10
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:13,412
<i>I want El cromo.</i>

11
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:18,059
<i>Gonna get some green
for this shit right here, homes.</i>

12
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:20,795
Fuck.

13
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,099
<i>Hey.</i>

14
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:41,549
Uh, guys?

15
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:45,018
Those are chrome-plated lugs.
You're gonna strip them.

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,220
Look at this guy, eh?

17
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:48,015
The plating flakes off.

18
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:49,281
Yeah?

19
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,291
This is a lease.
No one's gonna pay to ride...

20
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:05,606
Shit.

21
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:11,112
Come on, man.

22
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:17,084
Uh, guys, guys.

23
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:18,412
What the fuck?

24
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,145
Guys, seriously, you
don't wanna do this.

25
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:26,158
Take him out.

26
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:33,961
Fuck him up!

27
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,508
No! Not the car!

28
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:49,383
Get that puto!

29
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:50,985
Fuck him up, man!

30
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:54,489
Fuck him up!

31
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,318
Get him!

32
00:02:58,527 --> 00:02:59,789
Hit that fool!

33
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,833
Motherfucker!

34
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,431
Shit.

35
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Fuck.

36
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,130
Everyone's asleep, Burt.

37
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,196
Sleepwalking.
Between the ice caps,

38
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:56,611
the pornographers,
poisoned water, mutants...

39
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:58,441
it's all connected.

40
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:00,612
Hey, Clyde. It's 2029.

41
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:03,216
Why are we still talking about mutants?

42
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,986
Hey, it's me.
I'm in the car.

43
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:08,189
Yeah, it was a good trip.

44
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,118
Killed it up and down the fence.

45
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,794
USA! USA! USA!

46
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:20,594
USA! USA! USA! USA!

47
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:48,993
Wolverine.

48
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:51,966
I knew it was you.

49
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:54,663
- Oh, fuck.
- Please!

50
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,360
I'm in trouble!

51
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:58,630
You're the only one that could help!

52
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,603
Get the fuck away from me!

53
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,143
Please!

54
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,215
Logan!

55
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:17,491
Who was that?

56
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:19,526
I don't know, some crazy lady.
Don't worry.

57
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,519
As I live and breathe, the Wolverine.

58
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:27,788
And he's a junkie now.

59
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:29,395
Who the fuck are you?

60
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:33,064
You know, you got some
buckshot in your door.

61
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:34,935
I heard you was in Phoenix.

62
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:39,199
But then, last night, some friends
of mine in Texas HP called...

63
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:42,903
and told me they found
three dead cholos in a pullout on 54.

64
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,209
Not unusual, I know.

65
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:48,883
Except one was missing a hand,
another one a leg.

66
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:54,645
So they was thinking it was either
an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger.

67
00:07:55,457 --> 00:08:00,395
But neither one of them can drive,
one being fictional, the other one extinct.

68
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:04,731
And since the wheel lugs they found
belonged to a '24 Chrysler...

69
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:09,461
and, well...
this is a '24 Chrysler.

70
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,407
She found you yet?

71
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:14,734
Gabriela?

72
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,005
See...

73
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:20,681
I'm not looking for you,
Wolvie.

74
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:24,648
Well, not really. I'm looking
for someone who's looking for you.

75
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,683
She took something of mine
when I wasn't looking.

76
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,654
Something for which I am responsible.

77
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:34,422
Mexican lady.

78
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,295
Has her sights on you now.

79
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:41,128
Doesn't ring any bells?

80
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,827
I don't know any Gabriela,
so get the fuck out of my car.

81
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:45,673
Oh.

82
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:47,975
You know...

83
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,677
I know what you're hiding, amigo.

84
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:53,941
The old cue ball south of the border.

85
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:55,842
What do you want?

86
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:57,609
A little co-operation.

87
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:08,555
I'm a fan, by the way.

88
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:18,305
Fuck, fuck!

89
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:21,736
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.

90
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:24,871
I know I said June, but
I need the boat now.

91
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,547
Why would that mean
the price go up?

92
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,807
Listen to me.

93
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,814
I know you wanted 70...

94
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,322
Okay, what if I could put together
$45,000 cash right now?

95
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:36,047
Hello? Hello?

96
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:37,350
Shit.

97
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:41,823
Hey, Sam.

98
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,030
Morning.

99
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,311
"I know that virtue
to be in you, Brutus.

100
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:37,951
"As well as I do know
your outward favor.

101
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:40,417
"Well, honor is the
subject of my story."

102
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,055
He's having a bad day.

103
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:43,588
They're all bad days.

104
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:46,593
He needed these six hours ago.

105
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,621
This is not enough, you know.

106
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,098
Won't see us through the week.

107
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:55,428
I'm working on it.

108
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:58,806
Your turn.

109
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,065
I've had a rough night.

110
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:03,769
Poor you.

111
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:11,580
In other news, he told me last night
he's communicating with someone.

112
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:13,686
He's not talking to anybody.

113
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,116
Don't be so sure.

114
00:11:15,323 --> 00:11:17,291
He's got all these details.

115
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:20,017
I thought that tank was
supposed to act as a barrier.

116
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,696
- It's got them cracks in it.
- Just please stop.

117
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:24,365
Bottom left.

118
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:32,403
You're not listening.

119
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:35,872
He's been asking questions
again about why we're here.

120
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:37,669
I think he's trying to read my mind.

121
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,141
That's what these are for.

122
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,342
Eating his curds and whey.

123
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:46,179
Then came a big spider
Which sat down beside her.

124
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:47,548
And frightened Miss Muffet...

125
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:03,162
Friends, I have good
news for you today!

126
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,736
It's not about what you do.

127
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,873
It's not about your deeds.

128
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:08,442
You can't live up to God's rules.

129
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:12,602
He knows that you can't.
It's okay, we're imperfect.

130
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,374
Make way, sir.

131
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:18,712
I said make way!

132
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,014
The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell!

133
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:24,521
Get it with chicken! Get it with steak!

134
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:26,751
And with the cheese baked
right in the shell...

135
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:28,690
it's the next big thing!

136
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:30,865
Go now while supplies last.

137
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,765
Who are you?

138
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:35,463
You know who I am.

139
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,968
You're the man who puts me to sleep.

140
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,367
We both could use some sleep.

141
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:40,939
No! No!

142
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:47,546
What are you doing to me?

143
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:48,749
Charles.

144
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:52,086
Come on, now.

145
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:36,262
How long have I been here?

146
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:58,011
What are these?

147
00:13:58,219 --> 00:13:59,311
You remember what they are.

148
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:01,455
The shots mellow the seizures.

149
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,183
The pills keep them from happening.

150
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:07,327
How about you blow on
them to make them safe?

151
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:08,621
Fuck off, Logan.

152
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,297
So you remember who I am now.

153
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:12,796
I always know who you are.

154
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:15,469
It's just sometimes I
don't recognize you.

155
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:17,797
Take the pills.

156
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:26,374
You leave me alone with
that fucking albino.

157
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,014
He doesn't listen to me.

158
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,314
I know a damn speciation
when I see one.

159
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,519
A what?

160
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:35,679
Speciation.
New mutant, a young one.

161
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:37,724
There are forces trying to kill them.

162
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:39,522
- Forces?
- They want help.

163
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,191
Forces, forces.

164
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:44,729
It's too bad you're not
in that business anymore.

165
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:47,493
They don't want me, they want you.

166
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,070
Oh, yes, that's how
fucking stupid they are.

167
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:57,073
They're waiting for you
at the Statue of Liberty.

168
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:59,439
The Statue of Liberty
was a long time ago,

169
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:00,878
Charles, a long time.

170
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:04,042
There are no new mutants.
Understand?

171
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:07,415
Hasn't been a new one born
in 25 years. Not anywhere.

172
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:09,021
You always thought...

173
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,856
we were part of God's plan.

174
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:16,797
But maybe...

175
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:20,426
Maybe we were God's mistake.

176
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:32,979
What a disappointment you are.

177
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,044
When I found you...

178
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:41,052
you were pursuing a
career as a cage fighter.

179
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:44,448
A warm capper to a
life as an assassin.

180
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,820
Hooked on barbiturates.

181
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,258
You were an animal.

182
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:51,963
But we took you in.

183
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:55,728
I gave you a family.

184
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:57,228
And they're gone now.

185
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:58,438
Logan.

186
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:00,807
Logan...

187
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:04,444
What did you do?

188
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:08,110
What did you do?

189
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,341
Answer me! Why are we here?

190
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:12,280
No one should live like this.

191
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:13,852
Drugged in a fucking tank!

192
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:16,319
- It's for your own good.
- No, it's not!

193
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:21,993
You're waiting for me to die.

194
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:07,393
I don't wanna fight,
but there's things we need to discuss.

195
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,794
What things?

196
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,219
Well, would it be
considered nagging

197
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:16,640
if I was to repeat my
previous observation...

198
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:19,404
that the dose is too low
to suppress the seizures?

199
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:23,144
It's what the guy gave me.

200
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,615
Wasn't in a position to make demands.

201
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,151
I almost died this morning.

202
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:28,989
- That seizure was...
- It was barely a minute.

203
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,124
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.

204
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,422
You're less affected.

205
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:34,458
You know he needs a higher dose.

206
00:18:34,662 --> 00:18:37,392
And I know you got more money
squirreled away.

207
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:38,865
That money's to get us out of here.

208
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,595
No, not us.
You and him.

209
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:42,394
You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.

210
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:43,900
"Sun" is the keyword.

211
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:47,268
I hardly see myself cowering
below decks like Nosferatu.

212
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:48,475
Do you?

213
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:52,340
Folding your underpants,
and making him spotted dick.

214
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:57,757
Found this in your pocket.

215
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:00,811
Adamantium.

216
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:04,291
If you are planning
to blow your brains out...

217
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:06,126
could you wait till you're
out on the high seas?

218
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:08,789
- I just mopped these floors.
- I don't need this shit.

219
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:21,873
A year ago, you asked me to help you.

220
00:19:23,144 --> 00:19:24,839
And God knows I've tried.

221
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:31,279
But I can't help you, Logan, not really,
if you're not going to talk to me.

222
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,947
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.

223
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:36,783
You don't wanna talk about that.

224
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:40,691
Or the booze you're drinking.

225
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:43,728
Or the pus you're wiping away
from your knuckles.

226
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,831
Or the blood I wash from your clothes.

227
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,362
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.

228
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:51,828
The ones that aren't healing.

229
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:54,606
And I'm pretty sure,
you don't wanna talk about the fact

230
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,540
that you can't read the
label on that bottle.

231
00:19:58,212 --> 00:19:59,406
It says, "lbuprofen."

232
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:02,708
That was my favorite mug.

233
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,048
Stay out of my shit.

234
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:08,695
Something's happening to you, Logan.

235
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:11,416
On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.

236
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:19,425
Best night ever!

237
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:22,896
Hey, driver.

238
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:43,446
I love you. I love you.

239
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:45,285
You're such a doll.

240
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,610
Mr. Logan.

241
00:21:43,818 --> 00:21:44,818
Oh, Jesus.

242
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:46,579
Please. We need a ride.

243
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:48,652
Not available.
Call a cab.

244
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:49,896
My name is Gabriela Lopez.

245
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:51,124
I don't wanna know your name, lady.

246
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,524
There are men after us.

247
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,024
We need to get out of here.

248
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:55,923
Go north, cross to Canada.

249
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,654
Anyone can do that job.

250
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:58,865
I'll give you $50,000.

251
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,096
How did you find me, huh?

252
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:02,802
'Cause you are fucking
up my life, lady!

253
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,165
The people after you,
they're on my ass now!

254
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:07,432
Sightings were posted.

255
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:09,872
- Laura, go inside.
- What sightings?

256
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:13,880
People said someone who looked like
the Wolverine was in El Paso, driving.

257
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:15,639
Said he looked old.

258
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:19,882
Hey!

259
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,021
I told you to stop it with that ball!

260
00:22:22,223 --> 00:22:23,281
- Bad girl!
- No, please.

261
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:25,015
- I told you, bad girl!
- No, please.

262
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:26,326
Mamacita's gonna have to pay for that.

263
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:27,327
Stop, please. No.

264
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,830
Shit!

265
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:34,554
They're gonna have to pay for damages.

266
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,303
And she has cash.

267
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:38,505
I've seen it.

268
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:40,627
You should get your fat
ass back in your office.

269
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:41,628
You'll get your money.

270
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:46,466
Don't let her call anyone, please.

271
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,692
They will find us.
They will kill us.

272
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:58,243
I am a nurse.

273
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,946
Was. In Mexico City.

274
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,542
When did that happen?

275
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:08,117
This morning.
Near the border.

276
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,087
I got away from them, but...

277
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:16,462
...now they know my car.

278
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,499
Look, I gotta go.

279
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,898
No, wait. Please. Here.

280
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:26,466
Please, wait! Look.

281
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:29,336
Look. Here, take this.
It's $20,000.

282
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:31,674
Here.
Take us to this address.

283
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:35,308
You can have $30,000
more when we get there.

284
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,743
My friends there will give it to you.

285
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:40,685
They will be waiting.

286
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,152
They will give you anything.

287
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,417
Where did you get this?

288
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:46,923
My boyfriend.

289
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:50,420
He wants to kill me and take her.

290
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:55,124
And that's your daughter?

291
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,171
Yes.

292
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:04,276
I know you're still good inside.

293
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:05,558
I know you want to help us.

294
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:06,679
You don't know anything about me.

295
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Please!

296
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:11,013
I promise, there will be
no problems if we leave now.

297
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:13,049
I can't just leave to North Dakota!

298
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:14,813
- We have to be there Friday.
- Or what?

299
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:17,482
Or we miss our chance to cross.

300
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,116
Please.

301
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:21,319
You have to. Please.

302
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:25,889
Please.

303
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:35,069
- I like those.
- Huh?

304
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,936
They make you look younger.

305
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:42,712
Charles, listen.

306
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,414
I gotta go away for a few days, okay?

307
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,420
I got a long ride for
some good money...

308
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,469
but when I get back,
we're gonna get outta here.

309
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,558
We're gonna drive down to Yelapa.

310
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,980
We're gonna get ourselves a boat.

311
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:55,908
And we're gonna go live on the ocean.

312
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:58,064
Will you be safe there?

313
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:02,531
Yeah. We'll be safe.

314
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:04,294
Look what Logan got us, Charles.

315
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:11,904
Be back in a few days.

316
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,247
Shit.

317
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:29,019
- Logan.
- Yeah?

318
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:30,315
What happened?

319
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:31,889
Did something go wrong?

320
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,525
The job was wrong to begin with.

321
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:55,081
Logan!

322
00:26:58,418 --> 00:26:59,476
Logan!

323
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:00,710
What?

324
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:04,881
Who does this belong to?

325
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:11,798
Who's that?

326
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:18,036
Thought you were supposed
to see shit coming.

327
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:19,364
I can track mutants.

328
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:21,564
I'm a glorified truffle pig,
not a clairvoyant.

329
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:23,402
Go inside and keep Charles quiet.

330
00:27:23,544 --> 00:27:24,841
Go inside now!

331
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,019
You need to turn around, asshole.

332
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:37,123
This is private property.

333
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,451
Yes, it is.

334
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:42,551
In fact, I believe it belongs
to a multinational smelting company...

335
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,128
based in Shanghai.

336
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,961
Where are you keeping the old man? Hmm?

337
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,567
Is he over there?

338
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:53,432
Or is he there?

339
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:55,608
That'd be smart.

340
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:59,374
I'd like to meet him.

341
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,307
I'm told the HSA classifies his brain
as a weapon of mass destruction now.

342
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,286
Damn shame, what happened back east.

343
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,745
He's been dead for a year.

344
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:13,051
I need the girl.

345
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
What girl?

346
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:16,581
The one that goes along with
that ball you're holding.

347
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,621
There's no girl here.

348
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,424
I know you went to the motel.

349
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:21,828
Yeah, I was called there.

350
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:23,900
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.

351
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:26,572
Just the woman.
Such as she was.

352
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:30,909
So, you saw Gabriela.

353
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,510
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.

354
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,790
You didn't shoot the
poor thing, did you?

355
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:41,116
- No, did you?
- I asked you first.

356
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:43,653
- I don't like guns.
- Of course.

357
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:47,188
I wish you'd called me, Logan.

358
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,520
Like I asked.

359
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:52,824
See?

360
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,024
You're not the only one
that's been enhanced.

361
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,937
Logan. Logan!

362
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:07,113
This is Laura.

363
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:08,881
Caliban, come!

364
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:11,783
This is who I've been
telling you about.

365
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:13,646
This is Laura.

366
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:16,217
We've been waiting for you.

367
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:22,328
Come, come here.

368
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,861
It's okay.

369
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:26,365
Come.

370
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,061
Laura.

371
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:33,705
It's okay. It's okay.

372
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:36,943
Come.

373
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:38,444
Come.

374
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:43,307
Come. It's okay. You
can stay here, Laura.

375
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,850
It's safe.

376
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:46,580
We can look after you here.

377
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Come on.

378
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:52,253
Looks like ex-military.
Bounty hunter, maybe?

379
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,459
Worse.

380
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:55,853
Is he by himself?

381
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:57,087
Yeah, not for long.

382
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:01,024
You get him back in his ride,
take him out to the wash and dump him.

383
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:02,895
What if he wakes up before I get there?

384
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:10,167
Text me where you are.
We'll pick you up.

385
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:24,924
Yes.

386
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:30,396
Logan.

387
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:32,421
- Logan.
- Hey. Hey!

388
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:36,726
You'll get it back after I figure out what
you and your mother have got us into.

389
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:38,131
- No, Logan.
- What?

390
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,306
I think the...

391
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:51,480
Logan, the woman that you met,
that's not her mother.

392
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,651
- So she talks?
- We're communicating.

393
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,049
Communicating.

394
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:58,885
Take these now.

395
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,520
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.

396
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,856
And you can't have an attack
out there, you understand?

397
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:09,263
Yes, but this is the mutant
that I told you about.

398
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,164
- She needs our help.
- She's not a mutant.

399
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,669
- Yes, she is!
- What's her gift, Charles?

400
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,307
Eating? Pipe throwing?

401
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:19,436
It's okay.

402
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,958
Oh, yeah.

403
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:43,033
Take the gun.
Dump the body.

404
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,261
Text me when you're on the way back.

405
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:46,752
You have anything else you need?

406
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,432
Food for the kid?

407
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,340
You're fucked now, mutie.

408
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:07,853
It's okay.

409
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:11,823
- Choo-choo.
- It's not a choo-choo.

410
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,502
It's okay. Sit down.

411
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:18,966
- We gotta go.
- What?

412
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:20,696
- What's going on? Where?
- Stay here.

413
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:22,340
- Don't move.
- Where are we going?

414
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:25,870
Hey, don't worry.
He will be back for you.

415
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,746
Logan, the girl.
You've got to go back for the girl.

416
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:40,190
Logan, what about the girl?

417
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:43,195
Logan.

418
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,733
Logan, we mustn't forget about Laura.

419
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,235
She's not our problem.

420
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,082
Shit!

421
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:12,324
Ah, shit!

422
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:42,288
Logan.

423
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:43,380
Yeah, I'm thinking.

424
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,590
The child.

425
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:47,052
Logan, we mustn't forget Laura.

426
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,420
- Please be quiet.
- Logan.

427
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:53,666
Huh.

428
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,597
- Charles Xavier.
- Where's Caliban?

429
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:58,069
America's most wanted octogenarian.

430
00:33:58,271 --> 00:33:59,738
I'm a nonagenarian, actually.

431
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:06,812
Ah.

432
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,715
Where's Caliban?

433
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:13,385
Why don't you tell me
where the girl is first?

434
00:34:13,386 --> 00:34:15,306
Or I could ask Cue Ball.
He seems quite friendly.

435
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:16,921
I told you, she's not here.

436
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:19,353
Where's Caliban, motherfucker?

437
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,020
Well, I left him in the same ditch
he was gonna leave me in.

438
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:42,615
Jesus, Wolverine, seeing you like
this just breaks my damn heart.

439
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,776
As soon as I rip it out
of your chest, fuck-stick.

440
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:53,950
Go get her.

441
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,157
Laura.

442
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,106
That a girl!

443
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:16,542
Hey, baby.

444
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:27,147
Laura...

445
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:31,156
Laura!

446
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:34,320
Honey, you wanna stay where you are.

447
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:36,359
You wanna see your friends, right?

448
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:39,293
Command, stop.

449
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,792
You said alive or dead.

450
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,136
Laura!

451
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:46,805
Laura.

452
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:49,505
Laura.

453
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,370
No. No.

454
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:54,670
Move! Go!

455
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,614
Move! Go!

456
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:07,554
Stop shooting!

457
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:10,855
She heals! Move! Go!

458
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,998
Holy shit!

459
00:37:58,578 --> 00:37:59,602
Gotcha!

460
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:09,385
Ah!

461
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,082
Come on, hold her down.

462
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:06,768
As I told you, Logan,
she's a mutant like you.

463
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Hold on!

464
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:12,645
Very much like you.

465
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:35,969
Laura, are you all right?

466
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,778
Ahh!

467
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:55,994
Move!

468
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:05,904
Hold on!

469
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:13,507
Fuck! Come on!

470
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:16,181
Come on!

471
00:40:23,222 --> 00:40:24,246
Shit.

472
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,606
Fall in! Let's go!

473
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:26,747
Oh, watch out!

474
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,120
Ah!

475
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:11,921
Sit back.

476
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:22,669
Bring me the tracker.

477
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:31,183
You.

478
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,451
Who the hell are you?

479
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,789
Hey! I asked you a question.
Who are you?

480
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:41,550
You know who she is, Logan.

481
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:43,486
No, I don't.

482
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:45,857
Does she remind you of anybody?

483
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:19,693
I read about you when I was a kid.

484
00:43:21,534 --> 00:43:23,229
I believe you're thinking
of someone else.

485
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:24,369
Hmm.

486
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:35,775
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
you used to work for my team.

487
00:43:36,382 --> 00:43:39,044
You were helping round up
all those old mutes.

488
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:41,248
What changed?

489
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:43,622
You got religion?

490
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,224
I'm gonna need you to do
one more thing for the good guys...

491
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,535
and track one more special mute for me.

492
00:44:00,673 --> 00:44:01,901
I'm not helping you.

493
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:04,075
Of course, you'd say that.

494
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:07,610
But I got a theory that
people don't really change.

495
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,478
Beware of the light.

496
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:18,047
Caliban, I bet that's what your mama
told you every day when you was a kid.

497
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,592
Beware of the light.

498
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:34,234
Now, let's not bring out
the worst in each other.

499
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,830
The girl is not worth it, trust me.

500
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:38,336
She's not a natural fuck-up like you.

501
00:44:38,544 --> 00:44:41,172
She's a business
mistake, a R&D gone bad.

502
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,574
There's liability.

503
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:46,178
They can't have things with patents
running around, hurting people, can they?

504
00:44:47,386 --> 00:44:50,846
We need to get her off the board
before she hurts anybody else.

505
00:44:51,057 --> 00:44:53,651
Someone you care about, maybe.

506
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,597
So, get to sniffin'.

507
00:45:07,073 --> 00:45:09,098
My name is Gabriela López.

508
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:10,709
I am a nurse.

509
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:15,112
And for 10 years, I worked for
Transigen Research in Mexico City.

510
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:18,977
Transigen is owned by
an American company.

511
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:24,822
What I am about to
show you is illegal...

512
00:45:25,191 --> 00:45:27,386
in the U.S. And Canada.

513
00:45:35,001 --> 00:45:37,196
They told us we were part
of a pharmaceutical study.

514
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:39,364
But, of course, that was a lie.

515
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:42,803
These children were born in Transigen.

516
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:47,876
They were born here,
and have never left.

517
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,917
They have never seen the sun
or the ocean, rain or snow...

518
00:45:54,353 --> 00:45:56,014
or any of God's creatures.

519
00:45:56,956 --> 00:45:58,856
They have no birth certificates...

520
00:45:59,392 --> 00:46:03,252
no names, besides the ones
we have given them.

521
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:10,267
They were raised in
the bellies of Mexican girls.

522
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:12,369
Girls no one can find anymore.

523
00:46:13,105 --> 00:46:16,336
Their fathers are semillas genéticas...

524
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:18,009
special seeds in bottles.

525
00:46:32,558 --> 00:46:34,048
- Birthday? No birth.
- María.

526
00:46:35,061 --> 00:46:36,756
We do not dress them up for Halloween.

527
00:46:37,496 --> 00:46:40,056
We do not call them
"baby" or kiss boo-boos.

528
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:42,100
Don't think of them as children.

529
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:43,141
Think of them as things...

530
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:44,634
with patents and copyrights.

531
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:45,804
Comprende?

532
00:46:45,905 --> 00:46:46,905
Si, señor.

533
00:46:47,673 --> 00:46:50,602
They thought we were too poor
and stupid to understand.

534
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,210
We're poor, yes...

535
00:46:53,412 --> 00:46:54,412
but we are not stupid.

536
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:55,639
Use your powers.

537
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:04,286
This is business.

538
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,924
They are making soldiers.

539
00:47:07,526 --> 00:47:08,550
Killers.

540
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,593
These are babies of mutantes...

541
00:47:24,443 --> 00:47:26,502
- North Dakota.
- Mmm.

542
00:47:26,979 --> 00:47:28,844
You took that woman's money.

543
00:47:29,048 --> 00:47:31,448
You said you would
take the child there.

544
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,188
What is she?

545
00:47:39,658 --> 00:47:41,285
She's your daughter, Logan.

546
00:47:43,462 --> 00:47:45,157
Alkali has your genetic code.

547
00:47:45,364 --> 00:47:46,490
Not just mine.

548
00:47:46,632 --> 00:47:47,632
Logan...

549
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,800
I don't want to talk about it.

550
00:47:48,801 --> 00:47:50,035
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.

551
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:51,367
- Logan...
- Just stop.

552
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:53,370
I have to pee.

553
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:07,485
Last ride.

554
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:13,016
You're welcome.

555
00:48:19,598 --> 00:48:22,230
Stop it. For God's sake,
I can do this myself!

556
00:48:22,435 --> 00:48:23,601
Yeah, well, you're not doing it.

557
00:48:23,602 --> 00:48:24,728
Just get on with it.

558
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,360
Not with you standing there.

559
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:28,062
Trust me, I'm not lookin'.

560
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:03,108
Hello.

561
00:49:03,742 --> 00:49:04,766
Hi, there!

562
00:49:05,311 --> 00:49:06,871
You know you gotta pay for that, right?

563
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:11,541
Hey! Where's your mommy and daddy, huh?

564
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,820
Come on.

565
00:49:15,988 --> 00:49:17,080
That's enough.
These, too.

566
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,693
- Shit!
- Not okay!

567
00:49:24,897 --> 00:49:26,057
Sorry.

568
00:49:27,366 --> 00:49:28,993
Um, do you sell phone chargers?

569
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:30,493
Uh...

570
00:49:36,275 --> 00:49:37,435
Come on. Get in the car.

571
00:50:03,836 --> 00:50:05,701
As the children became older...

572
00:50:05,905 --> 00:50:07,896
Laura. Laura.

573
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:10,237
...they became more difficult.

574
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:14,374
They could not be controlled.

575
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:20,216
The company made their
bodies into weapons.

576
00:50:20,986 --> 00:50:22,920
Tried to teach them to kill.

577
00:50:23,122 --> 00:50:25,317
But they did not want to fight.

578
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:30,891
A soldier who will not
fight is useless.

579
00:50:33,032 --> 00:50:36,260
Inside this building,
they are working on something new.

580
00:50:37,303 --> 00:50:40,238
Something they think is better
than the children.

581
00:50:41,941 --> 00:50:43,421
Something they say is without a soul.

582
00:50:43,442 --> 00:50:44,876
Would you like to hear
my full lab report, Dr. Rice?

583
00:50:44,877 --> 00:50:46,504
You can't get good sushi here.

584
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:48,770
It's the Mexican equivalent
of Denver, Colorado.

585
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,640
They must have been successful.

586
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:55,952
About a week ago, they told us
to shut our program down.

587
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:01,291
They started putting
the children to sleep.

588
00:51:04,897 --> 00:51:07,798
We are going to save
as many children as we can.

589
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,195
I read about a place, up north.

590
00:51:10,536 --> 00:51:12,265
A place for mutants.

591
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:13,631
They call it Eden.

592
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,286
If you are watching this,
it means that I am dead.

593
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:36,622
I am not sure if any
other children survived.

594
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:39,127
We were separated.

595
00:51:39,331 --> 00:51:41,322
There is no more money.

596
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:43,160
That was a lie.

597
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,228
She's not my child.

598
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:49,138
But I love her.

599
00:51:50,376 --> 00:51:52,708
You may not love her.

600
00:51:54,346 --> 00:51:56,712
But she is your child.

601
00:51:57,883 --> 00:52:00,408
Please. I beg you...

602
00:52:00,686 --> 00:52:02,847
take her to safety.

603
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:52,130
Is this where we're hiding out?

604
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:53,862
We're not hiding out.

605
00:52:54,073 --> 00:52:56,098
We're gonna get a couple
of hours' sleep...

606
00:52:56,308 --> 00:53:00,069
clean up, get some new clothes,
get a new ride and get outta here.

607
00:53:05,617 --> 00:53:08,448
Harrah's Hotel and Casino
welcomes you to Oklahoma City.

608
00:53:09,188 --> 00:53:12,055
Please keep right for valet parking.

609
00:53:12,157 --> 00:53:13,157
Hey.

610
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:14,992
The fun never stops
at Harrah's Hotel and Casino.

611
00:53:14,993 --> 00:53:17,427
Hey, keep it out front, all right?

612
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:25,235
Come on, let's go.

613
00:53:52,264 --> 00:53:53,390
Hey, Laura.

614
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,599
Let's go.

615
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,758
We need clothes.

616
00:54:08,647 --> 00:54:09,671
Going up.

617
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,818
No, no, stop. Not a toy.

618
00:54:14,887 --> 00:54:17,515
- Uh, no, no, sorry, chair.
- What? Okay.

619
00:54:18,023 --> 00:54:19,149
- Push up again.
- Thank you.

620
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:20,416
Going up.

621
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:22,685
Come here. Stand there.
Just stand there.

622
00:54:23,796 --> 00:54:25,787
Logan, it's yours.

623
00:54:25,898 --> 00:54:26,922
What?

624
00:54:27,032 --> 00:54:28,072
I'm not gonna wear it now.

625
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:29,887
In the room. We'll get
changed in the room.

626
00:54:31,637 --> 00:54:32,968
You're a low-down, lying Yankee.

627
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
Prove it.

628
00:54:43,982 --> 00:54:46,644
This is a very famous picture, Laura.

629
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:48,547
It's almost 100 years old.

630
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:13,374
In life, in death, oh, Lord.

631
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:18,312
Abide with me.

632
00:55:22,187 --> 00:55:24,348
I first saw this picture

633
00:55:24,456 --> 00:55:26,924
at the Essoldo Cinema in my hometown...

634
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:29,218
when I was your age.

635
00:55:29,428 --> 00:55:32,727
Who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name.

636
00:55:32,931 --> 00:55:36,332
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.

637
00:55:47,312 --> 00:55:48,312
Shit.

638
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:31,219
I've heard that you're a low-down,

639
00:56:31,323 --> 00:56:32,950
Yankee liar.

640
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:34,419
Prove it.

641
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:45,265
You read these in your spare time?

642
00:56:46,872 --> 00:56:48,897
Oh, yeah, Charles,
we got ourselves an X-Men fan.

643
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,570
You do know they're
all bullshit, right?

644
00:56:51,777 --> 00:56:54,678
Maybe a quarter of it
happened, and not like this.

645
00:56:55,714 --> 00:56:56,942
In the real world, people die.

646
00:56:57,149 --> 00:57:00,518
And no self-promoting asshole
in a fucking leotard can stop it.

647
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:01,852
This is ice cream for bed-wetters.

648
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:02,751
Logan...

649
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:04,322
Her nurse has been feeding her
some grade-A bullshit.

650
00:57:04,323 --> 00:57:07,156
I don't think Laura needs reminding
of life's impermanence.

651
00:57:08,694 --> 00:57:10,992
Didn't you say something about
finding us a new ride?

652
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:14,127
Two more pills in one hour.

653
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,158
Give 'em to him.

654
00:57:16,835 --> 00:57:18,063
Why, Shane?

655
00:57:19,371 --> 00:57:21,396
A man has to be what he is, Joey.

656
00:57:22,674 --> 00:57:24,437
Can't break the mold.

657
00:57:24,643 --> 00:57:26,941
I tried it and it didn't work for me.

658
00:57:27,145 --> 00:57:29,443
Joey, there's no living with a killing.

659
00:57:29,648 --> 00:57:31,513
There's no going back from one.

660
00:57:31,717 --> 00:57:33,947
Right or wrong, it's a brand.

661
00:57:34,186 --> 00:57:35,619
A brand sticks.

662
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:39,918
Now you run on home to your mother,
and tell her everything's all right.

663
00:57:41,126 --> 00:57:44,186
And there aren't any
more guns in the valley.

664
00:58:04,883 --> 00:58:06,043
Who are you guys?

665
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:09,453
More cops? 'Cause I told
the other guys everything that I...

666
00:58:19,398 --> 00:58:21,696
Get up! In your cage, tracker.

667
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,527
You did your job.

668
00:58:45,257 --> 00:58:46,588
Fellas.

669
00:58:59,905 --> 00:59:01,395
Shit.

670
00:59:02,974 --> 00:59:04,271
Knock yourselves out.

671
00:59:06,378 --> 00:59:07,738
I'll tell you what.
Eight grand...

672
00:59:07,813 --> 00:59:10,043
I'll have her freshly painted
for you, new tires...

673
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:11,928
mounted, balanced, and
complete paperwork.

674
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:14,718
I'll give you 10 as-is,
if you can forget the paperwork.

675
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:18,749
Well, you still need new tires, man,
they're bald.

676
00:59:18,957 --> 00:59:20,049
How long will that take?

677
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:21,258
An hour.

678
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:54,859
Jesus.

679
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:10,371
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

680
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:22,676
Sir, are the keys in... Sir!

681
01:00:22,888 --> 01:00:24,856
You have the keys in it? Sir!

682
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:30,959
Shit!

683
01:00:54,553 --> 01:00:56,145
Charles. Charles!

684
01:00:57,322 --> 01:00:58,619
Argh!

685
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,120
Going up.

686
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:49,185
Oh, shit!

687
01:03:49,394 --> 01:03:50,554
You all right?

688
01:03:52,697 --> 01:03:53,789
We gotta get outta here.

689
01:03:57,235 --> 01:03:58,702
I'm so sorry.

690
01:04:00,405 --> 01:04:01,736
I'm so sorry.

691
01:04:27,432 --> 01:04:28,990
Emergency personnel are still on scene

692
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,760
at Harrah's Casino Hotel
in Oklahoma City...

693
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:35,769
where at least 400 guests were stricken
with temporary paralysis yesterday.

694
01:04:36,141 --> 01:04:39,537
Many are noting a similarity to the
Westchester incident over a year ago...

695
01:04:39,744 --> 01:04:41,371
that left over 600 injured...

696
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:44,280
and took the lives of seven mutants,
including several of the X-Men.

697
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:46,175
Knock it off.

698
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:50,554
I said, knock it off!

699
01:04:50,755 --> 01:04:52,279
She's a child, Logan.

700
01:04:54,826 --> 01:04:56,293
And, point of fact, she's your...

701
01:04:56,494 --> 01:04:58,294
How long has it been
since you took your meds?

702
01:05:00,432 --> 01:05:01,565
Tell me, how long has it been?

703
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:02,863
I don't know!

704
01:05:03,568 --> 01:05:04,865
Two days.

705
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:06,560
You saw what happened yesterday.

706
01:05:06,671 --> 01:05:08,972
If that shit had gone on any longer,
everyone in that casino...

707
01:05:08,973 --> 01:05:11,203
I did what I had to do to save Laura.

708
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:12,637
You didn't do anything.

709
01:05:12,844 --> 01:05:15,244
You just freaked out
and had a fucking seizure!

710
01:05:15,947 --> 01:05:19,280
I guess you prefer me
pharmaceutically castrated,

711
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:21,248
rambling on like a lunatic.

712
01:05:21,453 --> 01:05:22,920
So much easier for you.

713
01:05:23,121 --> 01:05:24,145
Easier? Jesus!

714
01:05:24,355 --> 01:05:26,550
There is nothing easy
about you, Charles, nothing!

715
01:05:26,758 --> 01:05:29,158
Yes, yes, please be
like the rest of the world...

716
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,828
blaming someone else
for your boring shit.

717
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,790
I know, Pop,
I'm such a giant disappointment.

718
01:05:34,032 --> 01:05:37,832
You honestly derive no
sense of purpose...

719
01:05:38,036 --> 01:05:39,060
from what we're doing?

720
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,760
Okay, what are we doing? Hmm?

721
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:45,066
There is a young mutant
sitting in our car.

722
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:46,276
Yeah, I see that.

723
01:05:46,478 --> 01:05:48,639
And where we're taking her,
there are others.

724
01:05:48,847 --> 01:05:50,610
Does that mean nothing to you?

725
01:05:50,815 --> 01:05:52,612
Yeah, means nothing to me.

726
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:54,377
Especially since Nurse Gabriela...

727
01:05:54,552 --> 01:05:56,952
made all that Eden shit up
with fucking comic books.

728
01:05:57,155 --> 01:05:58,782
What are you talking about?

729
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,110
Give those to him, will you?

730
01:06:00,158 --> 01:06:01,391
Take out two pills and
give them to him.

731
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:02,859
- Logan! Logan!
- Give 'em to him.

732
01:06:03,128 --> 01:06:04,186
Now!

733
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:10,167
I wanna see it.

734
01:06:34,025 --> 01:06:36,152
Dr. Rice. It's under control...

735
01:07:03,354 --> 01:07:05,754
Motherfucking auto-trucks.

736
01:07:06,057 --> 01:07:07,217
Language, Logan.

737
01:07:07,425 --> 01:07:09,518
And you're screaming at a machine.

738
01:07:09,727 --> 01:07:13,007
Oh, what? She can gut a man with her feet,
she can't hear a few naughty words, huh?

739
01:07:13,097 --> 01:07:15,657
She can learn to be better.

740
01:07:15,867 --> 01:07:17,266
You mean, better than me?

741
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:19,163
Actually, yes.

742
01:07:20,939 --> 01:07:23,066
And, by the way, Laura's foot claws...

743
01:07:23,274 --> 01:07:25,834
are the obvious result
of her gender, you know.

744
01:07:26,044 --> 01:07:27,204
Is that a fact?

745
01:07:27,412 --> 01:07:29,277
In a pride of lions, the female...

746
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,914
is both hunter and caregiver.

747
01:07:32,116 --> 01:07:33,174
Good to know.

748
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:36,053
She uses her front claws for hunting...

749
01:07:36,254 --> 01:07:37,551
and the back claws defensively.

750
01:07:37,655 --> 01:07:38,655
Oh, yeah?

751
01:07:38,756 --> 01:07:40,348
Thus, ensuring their survival.

752
01:07:46,664 --> 01:07:47,756
Hey, hey!

753
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:18,251
We should help them.

754
01:08:19,697 --> 01:08:21,961
No, we have to keep going.
Someone will come along.

755
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,793
Someone has come along.

756
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:37,844
Alert. Alert.

757
01:08:40,385 --> 01:08:41,909
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

758
01:09:20,546 --> 01:09:22,537
Hey, uh, you need a hand?

759
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:25,541
Ready? Go!

760
01:09:28,687 --> 01:09:29,984
Ah. Good, got it.

761
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:32,590
Come on, let's get home.

762
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:33,691
Laura!

763
01:09:33,726 --> 01:09:35,193
Thank you so much for your help.

764
01:09:35,327 --> 01:09:36,726
- I'm Kathryn.
- James.

765
01:09:36,929 --> 01:09:37,929
This is my son, Nate.

766
01:09:38,097 --> 01:09:39,325
- Hi.
- Hey.

767
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:40,862
That's your daughter?

768
01:09:41,066 --> 01:09:43,193
Yeah, that's Laura,
and that's my dad...

769
01:09:44,036 --> 01:09:45,162
Chuck.

770
01:09:45,371 --> 01:09:46,167
Come on, Laura, let's go.

771
01:09:46,372 --> 01:09:49,830
Well, can we show our appreciation and
treat the three of you to a decent meal?

772
01:09:50,042 --> 01:09:51,236
We don't live far from here.

773
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:53,468
- Uh, no, thanks.
- That would be lovely!

774
01:10:01,086 --> 01:10:02,951
My name is Dr. Rice.

775
01:10:03,155 --> 01:10:04,884
But you can call me Zander if you like.

776
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:09,958
My colleague tells me
you've been somewhat resistant.

777
01:10:10,329 --> 01:10:13,926
He believes you've been
dispensing delayed information...

778
01:10:14,133 --> 01:10:16,158
to allow your friends
to stay one step ahead.

779
01:10:19,671 --> 01:10:22,133
I'm offering you the possibility
of redemption, Caliban.

780
01:10:23,308 --> 01:10:26,438
To protect the world, and in
the process, save your friends.

781
01:10:26,645 --> 01:10:29,910
The girl is a rather
small price to pay for that.

782
01:10:30,115 --> 01:10:31,810
Unlike you, she's impure.

783
01:10:32,017 --> 01:10:33,746
She wasn't made by nature.

784
01:10:33,952 --> 01:10:35,078
She's a mistake of my own.

785
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,616
I did what I could and they
burned me and beat me.

786
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,484
Your colleagues are savages.

787
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:41,353
I agree.

788
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,425
The Reavers were very ineffective.

789
01:10:43,629 --> 01:10:46,462
But I'm bringing new tools to bear.

790
01:10:46,665 --> 01:10:48,966
But I still need someone
to point us in the right direction.

791
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:50,127
No, I can't help you.

792
01:10:50,335 --> 01:10:51,962
Breathe, breathe.

793
01:10:52,171 --> 01:10:54,139
Now, what does he have? The old man.

794
01:10:54,339 --> 01:10:56,034
Alzheimer's? ALS?

795
01:10:57,142 --> 01:11:01,309
A degenerative brain disease
in the world's most dangerous brain?

796
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,273
What a combo.

797
01:11:06,151 --> 01:11:08,176
Be nice.
Now, you know we got company.

798
01:11:08,387 --> 01:11:09,445
That's wonderful.

799
01:11:09,655 --> 01:11:10,781
Everybody, have a seat.

800
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:12,183
Nate, sit up.

801
01:11:12,391 --> 01:11:14,125
James, why don't you sit
at the end of the table?

802
01:11:14,126 --> 01:11:16,117
You wanna say grace? Say grace, baby.

803
01:11:17,029 --> 01:11:19,657
Uh, thank you, God, for this food...

804
01:11:20,365 --> 01:11:22,856
and for our new friends, the Howletts.

805
01:11:23,068 --> 01:11:24,330
Mmm. They came to our aid.

806
01:11:24,536 --> 01:11:25,867
- Amen.
- Amen.

807
01:11:26,338 --> 01:11:27,658
Here we go.
Here you go, Charles.

808
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:29,436
Thank you, sir.

809
01:11:44,323 --> 01:11:45,323
Mmm-hmm.

810
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,350
Oh, there's plenty more if she wants.

811
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:51,119
She's fine. Thank you.

812
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:52,330
This is delicious.

813
01:11:52,498 --> 01:11:53,738
- Oh, thank you.
- It's so good.

814
01:11:53,899 --> 01:11:55,230
Where are you all headed?

815
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:56,833
- Uh... Oregon.
- South Dakota.

816
01:11:58,670 --> 01:11:59,670
Um...

817
01:11:59,771 --> 01:12:02,137
Well, Oregon and then South Dakota.

818
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:03,638
Vacation?

819
01:12:03,842 --> 01:12:04,842
Uh... Yes.

820
01:12:05,244 --> 01:12:06,973
Uh, long overdue.

821
01:12:07,179 --> 01:12:08,373
We're city folk.

822
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,016
Always wanted to take
a road trip, see the country.

823
01:12:13,285 --> 01:12:14,650
Um...
And meet the people in it.

824
01:12:14,853 --> 01:12:16,047
That sounds lovely.

825
01:12:16,255 --> 01:12:18,923
Been trying to get Will here
to take a vacation for years now.

826
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:21,959
Oh. If we go traipsing all over the country,
who's gonna take care of this place?

827
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,825
Exactly. I say, let it go.

828
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:25,029
And live off what?

829
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:26,891
The Lord will provide.

830
01:12:27,099 --> 01:12:30,161
I'm still waiting for the Lord
to provide me with a new thresher.

831
01:12:30,402 --> 01:12:32,042
All the same, I'd love
to travel someday.

832
01:12:32,571 --> 01:12:34,664
And I bet you will.

833
01:12:35,274 --> 01:12:37,441
- I could drop out of school.
- Okay, let's not go that far.

834
01:12:37,442 --> 01:12:38,534
I mean, I'll do it.

835
01:12:38,744 --> 01:12:39,870
- No. No.
- Why not?

836
01:12:40,078 --> 01:12:41,398
You wanna travel, I wanna travel.

837
01:12:41,446 --> 01:12:42,446
Son. Son.

838
01:12:42,881 --> 01:12:44,081
That sounds good to you, right?

839
01:12:44,082 --> 01:12:45,276
This is the perfect plan.

840
01:12:45,484 --> 01:12:46,924
Why would you want to do that, Nate?

841
01:12:47,619 --> 01:12:50,053
Careful, you're speaking to
a man who ran a school...

842
01:12:51,623 --> 01:12:53,023
for a lot of years.
Right, Charles?

843
01:12:53,659 --> 01:12:55,559
Yes, it was a...

844
01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:59,289
It was a special needs school. Um...

845
01:13:00,499 --> 01:13:02,057
Uh-huh.
That's a good description.

846
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:04,234
He was there, too.

847
01:13:04,436 --> 01:13:05,436
Oh, yeah, no. Um...

848
01:13:05,504 --> 01:13:07,734
I got kicked out a few times.

849
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,802
I wish I could say you were a good pupil,
but the words would choke me.

850
01:13:33,498 --> 01:13:35,466
Ma'am, I can't thank
you enough for this.

851
01:13:35,601 --> 01:13:36,932
Uh, it was great.

852
01:13:37,135 --> 01:13:38,855
But we have a long drive
ahead of us, so...

853
01:13:39,037 --> 01:13:40,317
But you need to rest, don't you?

854
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:41,806
Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere.

855
01:13:42,007 --> 01:13:44,642
The nearest one is two hours
from here and it's not even that nice.

856
01:13:44,643 --> 01:13:47,512
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs
for your father and your daughter

857
01:13:47,713 --> 01:13:49,480
and you can sleep in the living
room on the convertible.

858
01:13:49,481 --> 01:13:50,715
Kathryn, it's very, very nice of you,

859
01:13:50,716 --> 01:13:51,944
but we really should go.

860
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,177
We can leave early in the morning.

861
01:13:54,386 --> 01:13:57,651
Break of dawn, as it were.

862
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:02,326
Okay, why don't we wash up, Pop?

863
01:14:02,527 --> 01:14:03,527
Okay.

864
01:14:03,629 --> 01:14:04,629
Sit.

865
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,525
Um, sweetie, you want some dessert?

866
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:14,001
Two days on the road,
only one meal, and hardly any sleep.

867
01:14:14,206 --> 01:14:16,197
She's 11, I'm fucking 90.

868
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:18,239
Well, that's 101 reasons
to keep moving.

869
01:14:18,443 --> 01:14:20,411
I'm not a box of avocados, Logan.

870
01:14:20,612 --> 01:14:22,372
And then what? We stay
the night, then what?

871
01:14:22,381 --> 01:14:25,839
Then we take her to
her friends in Eden.

872
01:14:28,186 --> 01:14:30,450
And then we buy the Sunseeker.

873
01:14:32,057 --> 01:14:33,354
Take the pills.

874
01:14:37,863 --> 01:14:38,863
Oh, shit!

875
01:14:40,532 --> 01:14:41,965
- What's going on?
- Nate!

876
01:14:42,167 --> 01:14:44,135
Go fill up the tub
before we lose pressure.

877
01:14:44,336 --> 01:14:45,633
Honey, check the sink.

878
01:14:45,837 --> 01:14:47,202
They shut it off again.

879
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:49,573
They are just not going
to let this thing go.

880
01:14:49,574 --> 01:14:51,094
Well, you might as well handle it now.

881
01:14:51,176 --> 01:14:53,077
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.

882
01:14:53,078 --> 01:14:55,480
We got three houseguests
and a sink full of dishes.

883
01:14:55,681 --> 01:14:57,273
All right, all right.

884
01:14:58,216 --> 01:15:00,776
The pump station that supplies us
is a mile and a half from here.

885
01:15:01,153 --> 01:15:02,780
Sometimes it gets itself shut off.

886
01:15:02,988 --> 01:15:03,988
- By assholes.
- Hey!

887
01:15:04,156 --> 01:15:05,156
No.

888
01:15:05,524 --> 01:15:07,389
My son is happy to go with you.

889
01:15:07,592 --> 01:15:09,355
No, no, no, that's fine.

890
01:15:09,561 --> 01:15:11,361
The men that do this,
sometimes they can be...

891
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:13,225
- I can go.
- No, you got homework.

892
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:14,899
All right, I'll go.

893
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,795
Just, uh, let me get my dad settled.

894
01:15:20,672 --> 01:15:21,672
All right.

895
01:15:23,341 --> 01:15:25,673
I'm just saying,
I don't care what the lawyer says.

896
01:15:28,046 --> 01:15:31,315
- But it's dangerous.
- I'm not gonna hurt our chances.

897
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:46,556
Want TV? There's TV here.

898
01:15:46,765 --> 01:15:47,765
I'm fine.

899
01:15:47,866 --> 01:15:48,992
Okay.
Get some rest.

900
01:15:49,101 --> 01:15:51,069
You know, Logan...

901
01:15:51,636 --> 01:15:53,763
this is what life looks like.

902
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,833
A home, people who love each other.

903
01:15:57,042 --> 01:15:58,168
Safe place.

904
01:15:58,376 --> 01:16:00,867
You should take a moment and feel it.

905
01:16:03,782 --> 01:16:05,682
Yeah. It's great.

906
01:16:05,884 --> 01:16:07,374
Logan. Logan!

907
01:16:09,387 --> 01:16:11,446
You still have time.

908
01:16:14,059 --> 01:16:18,120
Charles, the world is
not the same as it was.

909
01:16:20,599 --> 01:16:23,261
We're taking a risk hanging
around here, you know that.

910
01:16:23,835 --> 01:16:26,463
And where we're going, Eden...

911
01:16:27,405 --> 01:16:28,770
it doesn't exist.

912
01:16:29,674 --> 01:16:31,801
Her nurse got it from a comic book.

913
01:16:33,745 --> 01:16:36,111
You understand? It's not real.

914
01:16:36,815 --> 01:16:38,806
It is for Laura.

915
01:16:42,687 --> 01:16:45,087
It is for Laura.

916
01:16:48,093 --> 01:16:49,390
Get some rest.

917
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:56,092
Canewood Beverage bought up
everything out here, except for us.

918
01:16:56,301 --> 01:16:58,895
When we wouldn't sell,
they tried eminent domain...

919
01:16:59,104 --> 01:17:00,662
then screwing with our water.

920
01:17:01,706 --> 01:17:04,174
Couple of months ago,
somebody poisoned our dogs.

921
01:17:04,843 --> 01:17:07,471
So, out on the highway today,
those trucks...

922
01:17:08,446 --> 01:17:10,107
Who knows. Maybe.

923
01:17:11,349 --> 01:17:13,317
Hey, look at 'em.

924
01:17:13,885 --> 01:17:17,116
Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton
bodies and tiny little brains...

925
01:17:17,322 --> 01:17:19,449
shucking their cloned-up super corn.

926
01:17:19,658 --> 01:17:21,018
You know it tastes like shit, too.

927
01:17:21,059 --> 01:17:22,287
Why do people eat it?

928
01:17:22,494 --> 01:17:24,826
They don't. They drink it.
Corn syrup.

929
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:26,830
It's in those drinks
that everyone's having...

930
01:17:26,932 --> 01:17:30,493
to stay awake, cheer up,
feel strong, sexy, whatever.

931
01:17:30,702 --> 01:17:33,500
Used to be a time when
a bad day was just a bad day.

932
01:17:33,705 --> 01:17:35,070
Mine still are.

933
01:17:57,028 --> 01:17:59,758
Those are for breakaway roping.

934
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:04,835
Those are for barrel racing,
and right here is for pole bending.

935
01:18:05,036 --> 01:18:06,833
They're all second, third place.

936
01:18:07,038 --> 01:18:10,633
I'm not too good at it,
but my dad makes me.

937
01:18:19,384 --> 01:18:21,318
Do you want to listen?

938
01:18:31,663 --> 01:18:32,687
Do you like it?

939
01:18:36,701 --> 01:18:38,999
Um, here, you can take
it for tonight...

940
01:18:39,204 --> 01:18:42,230
and I'll get it back
from you in the morning.

941
01:18:55,086 --> 01:18:57,145
Looks like we're gonna be here a while.

942
01:19:30,622 --> 01:19:31,884
Should hold it.

943
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,182
Yeah.

944
01:19:33,491 --> 01:19:35,015
Till next time.

945
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,718
Thanks.

946
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:41,028
Hey, so, uh, how long has your girl

947
01:19:41,132 --> 01:19:42,724
- been like that?
- Huh?

948
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:44,294
Mute.

949
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:48,903
Uh, since the beginning.

950
01:19:49,007 --> 01:19:50,007
Mmm.

951
01:19:50,575 --> 01:19:52,600
Well, in a lot of ways, I envy you.

952
01:19:53,745 --> 01:19:56,825
They get to be Nate's age, with the
nonsense that comes out of their mouths...

953
01:19:57,916 --> 01:20:00,214
Makes you wonder the
whole point of it all.

954
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,110
Shit.

955
01:20:08,326 --> 01:20:09,326
Don't worry.

956
01:20:09,494 --> 01:20:10,927
We won't need it.

957
01:20:11,429 --> 01:20:12,429
Stay here.

958
01:20:19,871 --> 01:20:21,099
Evening, Mr. Munson.

959
01:20:21,673 --> 01:20:22,753
What brings y'all this way?

960
01:20:23,842 --> 01:20:25,241
Why don't you ask your boys?

961
01:20:25,443 --> 01:20:28,236
Mr. Munson, you understand
you're trespassing right now, right?

962
01:20:28,446 --> 01:20:30,982
I have an easement with the
previous owner of your property.

963
01:20:31,116 --> 01:20:32,413
Huh. Bullshit.

964
01:20:32,617 --> 01:20:34,585
"Previous" being the operative word.

965
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:37,048
Who's this?

966
01:20:38,423 --> 01:20:40,822
Just a guy telling you
to get back in your nice truck.

967
01:20:41,026 --> 01:20:43,654
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.

968
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:49,224
Hey, Carl...

969
01:20:49,968 --> 01:20:53,096
it looks like Mr. Munson
hired some muscle.

970
01:20:53,304 --> 01:20:54,601
Looks that way.

971
01:20:54,806 --> 01:20:56,239
He's a friend of mine.

972
01:20:56,441 --> 01:20:57,999
A friend with a big mouth.

973
01:20:58,376 --> 01:20:59,604
I hear that a lot.

974
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:01,278
Then you probably hear this, too.

975
01:21:04,015 --> 01:21:05,573
More than I'd like.

976
01:21:05,784 --> 01:21:06,910
Then you know the drill.

977
01:21:08,119 --> 01:21:11,349
I'mma count to three,
and you're gonna start walking away.

978
01:21:11,556 --> 01:21:12,636
I got rights to this water.

979
01:21:12,657 --> 01:21:13,783
- One.
- I have a lawyer now.

980
01:21:13,892 --> 01:21:14,892
Two.

981
01:21:16,628 --> 01:21:17,959
- Three.
- Ah. Ah.

982
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:19,457
You all right, boss?

983
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:22,959
You know the drill.

984
01:21:23,068 --> 01:21:23,966
Pick up my goddamn hat.

985
01:21:24,069 --> 01:21:25,069
Get the hell out of here.

986
01:21:25,236 --> 01:21:27,033
- You okay, boss?
- Fuck off.

987
01:21:27,238 --> 01:21:28,238
Go!

988
01:21:45,256 --> 01:21:46,655
You've had training.

989
01:21:47,192 --> 01:21:48,192
Some.

990
01:22:07,946 --> 01:22:10,039
Hey, don't wake her yet.

991
01:22:10,515 --> 01:22:12,847
Let her sleep another hour.

992
01:22:17,222 --> 01:22:18,917
You know, Logan...

993
01:22:20,692 --> 01:22:23,593
this was, without a doubt...

994
01:22:24,762 --> 01:22:29,722
the most perfect night
I've had in a very long time.

995
01:22:37,775 --> 01:22:39,766
But I don't deserve it.

996
01:22:41,746 --> 01:22:42,940
Do I?

997
01:22:46,417 --> 01:22:48,715
I did something.

998
01:22:51,422 --> 01:22:53,788
Something unspeakable.

999
01:22:59,764 --> 01:23:03,291
I've remembered what
happened in Westchester.

1000
01:23:07,972 --> 01:23:11,271
This is not the first
time I've hurt people.

1001
01:23:13,311 --> 01:23:16,576
Until today, I didn't know.

1002
01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:19,550
You wouldn't tell me.

1003
01:23:21,753 --> 01:23:27,714
So we just kept on
running away from it.

1004
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:35,793
I think I finally understand you.

1005
01:23:39,204 --> 01:23:40,466
Logan...

1006
01:24:08,299 --> 01:24:09,596
He's fantastic.

1007
01:24:09,801 --> 01:24:11,161
You said you only needed the girl!

1008
01:24:11,236 --> 01:24:13,329
I told you I was forced
to bring a new tool to bear.

1009
01:24:13,538 --> 01:24:14,738
Your friends had every chance.

1010
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:16,100
And so did you.

1011
01:24:17,242 --> 01:24:18,300
Nate?

1012
01:24:22,146 --> 01:24:23,443
Put her down.

1013
01:24:31,889 --> 01:24:32,889
Honey.

1014
01:24:33,491 --> 01:24:35,015
Stay down there, Will!

1015
01:24:37,395 --> 01:24:38,395
Stop!

1016
01:24:39,564 --> 01:24:40,564
Kathryn!

1017
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:42,526
Kathryn!

1018
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:43,895
Kathryn!

1019
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:13,488
Charles!

1020
01:25:14,565 --> 01:25:15,725
Charles!

1021
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,080
Hold this.

1022
01:25:30,248 --> 01:25:32,375
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

1023
01:25:35,053 --> 01:25:36,053
Here he comes.

1024
01:25:36,921 --> 01:25:39,123
I could pick him up, meet him halfway.

1025
01:25:39,324 --> 01:25:40,757
No, no, no. Let them come to us.

1026
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:43,051
We struggled with the X-23s.

1027
01:25:43,261 --> 01:25:45,962
We assumed, because they were children,
we could raise them without a conscience.

1028
01:25:45,963 --> 01:25:47,863
But you can't nurture rage.

1029
01:25:48,066 --> 01:25:50,367
You must simply design it from scratch.

1030
01:25:58,009 --> 01:26:00,375
Who the fuck is that?

1031
01:26:05,283 --> 01:26:06,545
Will Munson!

1032
01:26:09,754 --> 01:26:11,085
Just hold on, Charles.

1033
01:26:11,756 --> 01:26:13,883
Munson, God damn it, come out here!

1034
01:26:18,196 --> 01:26:19,196
Munson!

1035
01:26:20,965 --> 01:26:22,398
Come out here now!

1036
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:24,657
Come out here now, Munson.

1037
01:26:24,869 --> 01:26:26,131
There's that asshole.

1038
01:26:28,172 --> 01:26:29,469
Hello, asshole.

1039
01:26:29,674 --> 01:26:32,575
Listen, I'm willing
to let bygones be bygones.

1040
01:26:32,877 --> 01:26:34,674
I don't know what
Munson's paying you...

1041
01:26:35,313 --> 01:26:37,907
but Canewood can start
you out at five G.

1042
01:26:38,015 --> 01:26:39,073
A week, that is.

1043
01:26:41,319 --> 01:26:43,287
You best stay where you are, pal.

1044
01:26:43,488 --> 01:26:45,183
I'm the law out here.

1045
01:26:46,057 --> 01:26:47,786
No, no, no.

1046
01:26:49,193 --> 01:26:50,251
What in high...

1047
01:26:52,029 --> 01:26:53,860
What? Oh, shit!

1048
01:26:54,065 --> 01:26:55,065
Shoot him!

1049
01:26:57,068 --> 01:26:58,126
We need to intervene.

1050
01:26:58,336 --> 01:27:00,531
Well, he only listens to you, Doctor.

1051
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:04,599
24!

1052
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:06,910
Get back here!

1053
01:27:08,045 --> 01:27:09,171
Stop! Stop now!

1054
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:11,177
Hold this down, right now, tight!

1055
01:27:15,586 --> 01:27:17,315
- Our boat.
- What?

1056
01:27:22,727 --> 01:27:24,888
The Sunseeker.

1057
01:27:34,539 --> 01:27:35,539
No.

1058
01:27:44,415 --> 01:27:45,415
Come!

1059
01:27:45,616 --> 01:27:46,708
24!

1060
01:27:47,685 --> 01:27:49,016
Need some help out here!

1061
01:27:49,754 --> 01:27:51,588
I guess we're gonna have to
take care of this now.

1062
01:27:51,589 --> 01:27:53,056
- Pierce!
- Give me that.

1063
01:27:53,257 --> 01:27:54,577
Get your lily-faced ass out here!

1064
01:28:01,132 --> 01:28:02,326
Listen to me!

1065
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:04,133
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

1066
01:28:04,202 --> 01:28:07,398
All right, we gotta go around
that truck and flank them farmers.

1067
01:28:07,605 --> 01:28:08,902
Follow my lead.

1068
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,871
Bring extra ammo, take these clips.

1069
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:12,242
Come!

1070
01:28:12,276 --> 01:28:13,436
Now!

1071
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:15,675
Pick her up.

1072
01:28:26,491 --> 01:28:27,685
Beware the light.

1073
01:28:50,915 --> 01:28:52,246
What the hell are you?

1074
01:31:19,263 --> 01:31:20,525
Sit down.

1075
01:31:39,817 --> 01:31:41,079
Hold still.

1076
01:31:41,519 --> 01:31:42,816
Hold still.

1077
01:32:04,942 --> 01:32:07,077
- Get him on the truck.
- Yeah.

1078
01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:09,939
Go.

1079
01:32:15,686 --> 01:32:17,449
It's all right, it's all right.

1080
01:32:17,655 --> 01:32:20,590
It's all right.
You did fine, 24.

1081
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:22,656
You're healing. Just breathe.

1082
01:32:24,128 --> 01:32:26,596
You're a newborn, by any measure.

1083
01:32:26,797 --> 01:32:28,025
Just breathe.

1084
01:32:28,499 --> 01:32:29,557
Your body has work to do.

1085
01:32:29,767 --> 01:32:32,292
Hemostasis, angiogenesis,
epithelialization...

1086
01:32:32,503 --> 01:32:33,800
stromal cell proliferation.

1087
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:37,469
This will help you heal.

1088
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:39,865
Make you stronger.

1089
01:33:34,999 --> 01:33:36,125
Well...

1090
01:33:42,106 --> 01:33:43,937
It's got water, and...

1091
01:34:06,997 --> 01:34:08,294
It's got water.

1092
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:27,447
Fuck this. Fuck this.

1093
01:34:41,065 --> 01:34:43,124
God!

1094
01:34:48,405 --> 01:34:50,168
Fuck! Fuck!

1095
01:34:50,307 --> 01:34:51,307
Fuck!

1096
01:34:52,042 --> 01:34:53,042
Shit!

1097
01:35:05,689 --> 01:35:08,157
Fuck! Fuck!

1098
01:35:08,659 --> 01:35:10,149
Fuck!

1099
01:35:10,361 --> 01:35:11,988
Motherfucking...

1100
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:17,333
Shit!

1101
01:35:18,535 --> 01:35:20,560
Fuck! Fuck!

1102
01:35:48,465 --> 01:35:49,989
Welcome back.

1103
01:35:50,701 --> 01:35:52,635
I was starting to think
I was gonna have to tell...

1104
01:35:52,636 --> 01:35:54,516
that nice little girl
out in the waiting room...

1105
01:35:54,638 --> 01:35:56,105
her daddy's gone.

1106
01:36:02,279 --> 01:36:03,439
I'd always hoped...

1107
01:36:04,248 --> 01:36:08,685
that I'd get the chance
to meet someone like you.

1108
01:36:09,086 --> 01:36:10,713
There's so few of you left.

1109
01:36:13,257 --> 01:36:15,384
Nice to meet you, too, Doc.

1110
01:36:15,592 --> 01:36:16,952
But I really got to get on my way.

1111
01:36:16,961 --> 01:36:18,121
No, no, don't do that.

1112
01:36:18,329 --> 01:36:20,729
What you need is rest, and treatment.

1113
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:22,498
You need to check
yourself in somewhere.

1114
01:36:22,499 --> 01:36:24,899
- I'll be fine.
- No, you're not!

1115
01:36:25,135 --> 01:36:28,104
I mean, I know that you're different...

1116
01:36:28,305 --> 01:36:31,541
but that doesn't change the fact that
something inside you is poisoning you.

1117
01:36:31,742 --> 01:36:33,937
You got to check yourself
into a hospital.

1118
01:36:34,144 --> 01:36:35,771
Find out what it is!

1119
01:36:36,246 --> 01:36:37,406
I know what it is.

1120
01:36:38,349 --> 01:36:41,651
Please, mister, if you don't want to go
to a hospital, maybe I can help you.

1121
01:36:41,852 --> 01:36:43,046
Maybe I can
run some tests.

1122
01:36:43,253 --> 01:36:45,585
Look, Doc. You seem
like a nice guy, all right?

1123
01:36:45,789 --> 01:36:47,450
You wanna save a life, save your own.

1124
01:36:47,658 --> 01:36:48,658
Forget we were here.

1125
01:36:48,859 --> 01:36:49,917
Let's go.

1126
01:37:01,105 --> 01:37:02,105
Hey!

1127
01:37:02,673 --> 01:37:03,673
Hey!

1128
01:37:24,194 --> 01:37:26,128
You can't just take shit, you know.

1129
01:37:44,715 --> 01:37:46,876
I don't know how you got me here...

1130
01:37:47,684 --> 01:37:48,810
but thank you.

1131
01:37:48,919 --> 01:37:49,919
De nada.

1132
01:37:50,154 --> 01:37:51,280
Yeah.

1133
01:37:53,190 --> 01:37:54,487
You can talk?

1134
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,888
You can talk?

1135
01:37:58,762 --> 01:38:00,457
What the fuck?

1136
01:38:00,731 --> 01:38:01,789
Why in the fuck...

1137
01:38:01,999 --> 01:38:05,001
What's all this bullshit been
for the last 2,000 fucking miles?

1138
01:38:08,005 --> 01:38:09,632
What? Shut up.

1139
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,000
Shut the fuck up!

1140
01:38:11,108 --> 01:38:13,804
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca,
Delilah, Rictor.

1141
01:38:13,911 --> 01:38:16,141
What? Who's that?

1142
01:38:16,346 --> 01:38:17,472
Who is that?

1143
01:38:18,916 --> 01:38:22,408
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca,
Delilah, and Rictor.

1144
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:24,120
North Dakota.

1145
01:38:24,955 --> 01:38:26,217
What?

1146
01:38:26,356 --> 01:38:27,721
North Dakota, por favor.

1147
01:38:27,858 --> 01:38:29,018
Shit, okay. Look...

1148
01:38:29,126 --> 01:38:30,252
No. Por favor.

1149
01:38:31,895 --> 01:38:33,556
This place. Okay?

1150
01:38:33,764 --> 01:38:34,856
Your nurse,

1151
01:38:34,965 --> 01:38:37,195
she read too many
stories, you understand?

1152
01:38:37,401 --> 01:38:38,925
Too many stories!

1153
01:38:42,806 --> 01:38:45,536
I've seen it! I've seen it, okay?

1154
01:38:45,742 --> 01:38:46,834
This all here...

1155
01:38:47,044 --> 01:38:49,035
None of this...
No existo, okay?

1156
01:38:49,146 --> 01:38:50,146
You understand me?

1157
01:38:50,314 --> 01:38:53,010
- This Eden does not exist. No!
- Sí! Eden!

1158
01:38:53,217 --> 01:38:55,014
It's a fantasy, kid. See that?

1159
01:38:55,219 --> 01:38:58,049
Those are the names of the people
who just made this...

1160
01:38:58,155 --> 01:38:59,918
They made this whole thing up.

1161
01:39:00,424 --> 01:39:01,686
Okay? This whole...

1162
01:39:01,892 --> 01:39:04,723
It happened once, and they just
turned it into a big, fucking lie!

1163
01:39:04,928 --> 01:39:07,226
That's all this is. No!

1164
01:39:07,998 --> 01:39:09,056
Fuck.

1165
01:39:09,967 --> 01:39:11,025
No.

1166
01:39:11,568 --> 01:39:13,399
I know, I understand.

1167
01:39:13,837 --> 01:39:15,702
This is a long way.

1168
01:39:15,906 --> 01:39:16,906
You understand?

1169
01:39:16,974 --> 01:39:19,306
I am not taking you to North Dakota.

1170
01:39:22,513 --> 01:39:25,744
I am fucked up.
And I cannot get you there.

1171
01:39:25,949 --> 01:39:29,043
It is a two-day drive.
And I am not taking you...

1172
01:39:29,253 --> 01:39:31,949
Don't fucking hit me!

1173
01:39:32,156 --> 01:39:33,156
Don't hit me!

1174
01:39:33,957 --> 01:39:35,117
Jonah, Gideon...

1175
01:39:35,259 --> 01:39:36,492
- Stop saying those names.
- ...Rebecca...

1176
01:39:36,493 --> 01:39:37,493
Delilah, Rictor.

1177
01:39:37,528 --> 01:39:38,995
Right now.
Stop saying those names.

1178
01:39:39,129 --> 01:39:41,563
- Stop it! Stop!
- Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca...

1179
01:39:41,765 --> 01:39:44,131
Fuck it. Fine, fine.

1180
01:39:44,601 --> 01:39:46,262
You wanna go?

1181
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:48,167
I'll take you there.

1182
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,129
See for yourself.

1183
01:39:50,474 --> 01:39:52,738
Let's go to fucking fantasyland.

1184
01:40:05,656 --> 01:40:08,024
We understand the importance
of containment, Dr. Rice.

1185
01:40:08,325 --> 01:40:10,693
But you can't leave a war zone behind
like you did in Juárez.

1186
01:40:10,694 --> 01:40:13,296
Well, try to remind yourselves that
these are all little killing machines.

1187
01:40:13,297 --> 01:40:15,364
Machines who would've happily
disemboweled your family.

1188
01:40:15,365 --> 01:40:16,365
Not all.

1189
01:40:17,501 --> 01:40:20,527
I was told you want these assets
off-board, dead or alive.

1190
01:40:20,737 --> 01:40:21,931
Are you changing my brief?

1191
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:23,139
No.

1192
01:40:23,407 --> 01:40:24,635
All right, then.

1193
01:40:26,543 --> 01:40:27,601
Save tissue from this one.

1194
01:40:27,811 --> 01:40:29,870
He's a good tracker and had a high IQ.

1195
01:40:35,319 --> 01:40:36,650
Here you go.

1196
01:41:13,457 --> 01:41:14,457
Hey.

1197
01:41:22,266 --> 01:41:23,266
Hmm?

1198
01:41:23,467 --> 01:41:24,695
Let me drive.

1199
01:41:27,371 --> 01:41:28,668
Absolutely not.

1200
01:41:34,378 --> 01:41:35,902
Quit looking at me.

1201
01:41:40,317 --> 01:41:41,579
No comprende.

1202
01:41:43,086 --> 01:41:44,576
You are dying.

1203
01:41:47,491 --> 01:41:48,924
You want to die.

1204
01:41:51,828 --> 01:41:53,295
Charles told me.

1205
01:41:56,433 --> 01:41:58,628
What else did he tell you?

1206
01:41:59,102 --> 01:42:00,626
To not let you.

1207
01:42:12,816 --> 01:42:14,613
Hey, hey, hey!

1208
01:42:21,858 --> 01:42:22,858
Rest.

1209
01:45:07,424 --> 01:45:08,914
Keep it steady.

1210
01:45:11,261 --> 01:45:12,819
Swing him toward me.

1211
01:45:15,365 --> 01:45:16,365
Yeah.

1212
01:45:18,935 --> 01:45:21,096
Easy. Easy.

1213
01:45:54,371 --> 01:45:56,032
Is this good, Rictor?

1214
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:57,700
No, not so much. Less.

1215
01:46:04,047 --> 01:46:05,446
Hey!

1216
01:46:12,055 --> 01:46:13,283
Where am I?

1217
01:46:15,191 --> 01:46:16,852
Hey, what is it?

1218
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:18,522
Where did you get that?

1219
01:46:18,728 --> 01:46:20,025
Where we came from.

1220
01:46:20,697 --> 01:46:22,932
They gave it to us when we would fight.
It makes you stronger.

1221
01:46:22,933 --> 01:46:24,696
It makes you crazy, is what it does.

1222
01:46:24,834 --> 01:46:25,834
It'll kill you.

1223
01:46:25,936 --> 01:46:27,904
No, not if you use it in small doses.

1224
01:46:28,605 --> 01:46:29,867
It's helping you heal.

1225
01:46:31,374 --> 01:46:32,671
Where's Laura?

1226
01:46:32,876 --> 01:46:34,810
She's asleep down there.

1227
01:46:35,011 --> 01:46:36,842
Do you want me to wake her up?

1228
01:46:44,521 --> 01:46:45,681
No.

1229
01:47:06,943 --> 01:47:08,604
You had a nightmare.

1230
01:47:12,482 --> 01:47:14,245
Do you have nightmares?

1231
01:47:15,619 --> 01:47:16,619
Sí.

1232
01:47:19,656 --> 01:47:21,351
People hurt me.

1233
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:24,927
Mine are different.

1234
01:47:31,134 --> 01:47:32,533
I hurt people.

1235
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:51,910
You know what it is.

1236
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:55,655
It's made out of Adamantium.

1237
01:47:56,493 --> 01:47:58,654
It's what they put inside of us.

1238
01:47:59,629 --> 01:48:01,392
That's why it can kill us.

1239
01:48:03,266 --> 01:48:05,564
Probably what is killing me now.

1240
01:48:07,671 --> 01:48:08,899
Anyway...

1241
01:48:09,539 --> 01:48:11,234
I got this a long time ago...

1242
01:48:12,676 --> 01:48:16,112
and I kept it as a
reminder of what I am.

1243
01:48:18,381 --> 01:48:20,281
Now I keep it to, uh...

1244
01:48:27,223 --> 01:48:28,485
Actually, uh...

1245
01:48:31,961 --> 01:48:34,191
I was thinking of
shooting myself with it.

1246
01:48:34,864 --> 01:48:36,297
Like Charles said.

1247
01:48:42,072 --> 01:48:44,006
I've hurt people, too.

1248
01:48:47,043 --> 01:48:49,841
You're gonna have to learn
how to live with that.

1249
01:48:59,422 --> 01:49:01,390
They were bad people.

1250
01:49:05,228 --> 01:49:06,855
All the same.

1251
01:50:21,905 --> 01:50:24,135
Not funny.
That is not funny!

1252
01:50:25,775 --> 01:50:27,106
Hey! Hey, pal.

1253
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:29,608
How long have I been out?

1254
01:50:31,247 --> 01:50:32,567
How long have I been in that bed?

1255
01:50:32,615 --> 01:50:33,877
Two days.

1256
01:50:34,083 --> 01:50:35,417
You've been sitting here for two days?

1257
01:50:35,418 --> 01:50:37,019
Hey, go inside and tell
everyone to get packing.

1258
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:38,754
You can't do that.
You can't just stay here.

1259
01:50:38,755 --> 01:50:40,620
We had to wait.
It was the plan.

1260
01:50:40,824 --> 01:50:43,088
And everyone had till today
to find their way here.

1261
01:50:43,293 --> 01:50:45,961
If you keep waiting, Alkali will
find you and they will kill you all.

1262
01:50:45,962 --> 01:50:46,962
You need to get out!

1263
01:50:47,096 --> 01:50:49,155
We're leaving tomorrow before dawn.

1264
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:51,157
We're gonna cross the border.

1265
01:50:51,367 --> 01:50:52,925
It's a safe haven.

1266
01:50:54,204 --> 01:50:55,398
Same coordinates?

1267
01:50:55,605 --> 01:50:57,766
Yes, between noon and 5:00.

1268
01:50:57,974 --> 01:51:00,306
Satellites are blind then.

1269
01:51:00,510 --> 01:51:02,740
- Your asylum approved.
- Copy.

1270
01:51:18,862 --> 01:51:20,489
Swing it to your right, Laura.

1271
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,797
A little more. Yeah.

1272
01:51:26,002 --> 01:51:27,333
You see the woods?

1273
01:51:29,472 --> 01:51:30,472
Sí.

1274
01:51:31,074 --> 01:51:32,594
It's an eight mile hike through there.

1275
01:51:33,743 --> 01:51:34,835
And you see that pass?

1276
01:51:35,044 --> 01:51:36,136
Mm-hmm.

1277
01:51:36,346 --> 01:51:37,438
That's the border.

1278
01:51:39,382 --> 01:51:41,179
That's where we will be safe.

1279
01:51:48,491 --> 01:51:50,015
Come inside.

1280
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:58,460
Laura told me all that you did for her.

1281
01:51:58,902 --> 01:52:00,893
She was lucky to have you.

1282
01:52:03,406 --> 01:52:05,306
Take it.
She says it's yours.

1283
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:09,735
That's why you did it, right?

1284
01:52:12,015 --> 01:52:13,744
Yeah, well...

1285
01:52:14,584 --> 01:52:17,348
Look, I don't need it.
You do, okay?

1286
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,381
Suit yourself.

1287
01:52:41,044 --> 01:52:42,671
Your friends, they seem nice.

1288
01:52:42,879 --> 01:52:43,879
Kind of reminds me...

1289
01:52:45,615 --> 01:52:47,014
Hey, hey, what's going on?

1290
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:48,550
Huh?

1291
01:52:50,119 --> 01:52:51,519
You're with your pals.
You made it.

1292
01:52:52,488 --> 01:52:53,955
Where will you go?

1293
01:52:55,091 --> 01:52:56,558
Nearest bar, for starters.

1294
01:52:57,961 --> 01:53:00,361
Hey, I got you here.
That's all I signed up for.

1295
01:53:00,563 --> 01:53:02,394
I even gave back the money.

1296
01:53:02,598 --> 01:53:03,622
Such a nice man.

1297
01:53:03,766 --> 01:53:05,927
Hey, I never asked for this!

1298
01:53:06,669 --> 01:53:08,398
All right? Charles
never asked for this.

1299
01:53:08,604 --> 01:53:10,469
Caliban never asked for this.

1300
01:53:11,307 --> 01:53:13,298
And they are six feet under the ground!

1301
01:53:14,477 --> 01:53:16,437
Now, I don't know what Charles
put in your head...

1302
01:53:16,612 --> 01:53:19,376
but I am not whatever it is
you think I am, okay?

1303
01:53:20,817 --> 01:53:23,047
I only met you, like, a week ago.

1304
01:53:24,287 --> 01:53:28,083
You got your Rebecca, your Delilah,
your blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1305
01:53:28,291 --> 01:53:29,891
Everything you asked
for, you've got it!

1306
01:53:32,996 --> 01:53:34,827
And it is better this way.

1307
01:53:36,332 --> 01:53:38,232
Because I suck at this.

1308
01:53:40,003 --> 01:53:43,063
Bad shit happens to
people I care about.

1309
01:53:43,272 --> 01:53:44,899
You understand me?

1310
01:53:47,110 --> 01:53:48,577
Then I'll be fine.

1311
01:55:56,606 --> 01:55:59,473
Run! Towards the mountains! Run!

1312
01:57:09,645 --> 01:57:10,873
Run, Bobby, run!

1313
01:57:16,085 --> 01:57:17,085
Ah!

1314
01:57:35,037 --> 01:57:36,504
Go! Go!

1315
01:57:37,173 --> 01:57:38,173
Move faster!

1316
01:57:38,341 --> 01:57:40,381
We need to reach them
before they get to the border.

1317
01:58:57,253 --> 01:58:58,447
Move out!

1318
01:58:58,654 --> 01:58:59,654
Let's go, let's go!

1319
01:59:01,490 --> 01:59:02,923
Run! Run!

1320
01:59:03,125 --> 01:59:05,650
Corre, Jonah! Run!

1321
01:59:12,301 --> 01:59:13,791
I want you to breathe.

1322
01:59:14,003 --> 01:59:15,265
It's just a flesh wound, baby.

1323
01:59:31,554 --> 01:59:32,554
There she is.

1324
01:59:32,988 --> 01:59:33,988
We got her.

1325
01:59:36,525 --> 01:59:38,584
Back it up! Contain her.

1326
02:00:05,221 --> 02:00:06,221
Get behind me!

1327
02:00:27,777 --> 02:00:29,540
You took all the medicine.

1328
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:32,340
It's wearing off.

1329
02:00:59,141 --> 02:01:00,438
Go to your friends.

1330
02:01:01,744 --> 02:01:02,744
Go.

1331
02:01:04,246 --> 02:01:05,338
Laura?

1332
02:01:07,383 --> 02:01:08,680
You'll know when.

1333
02:01:20,830 --> 02:01:22,058
Nine o'clock.

1334
02:01:24,133 --> 02:01:26,363
That green juice is wearin' off, huh?

1335
02:01:27,403 --> 02:01:29,894
You know, for an old mute,
it's kind of a short high.

1336
02:01:30,406 --> 02:01:31,896
Be hard to keep them claws out, soon.

1337
02:01:32,107 --> 02:01:33,904
Waste this dick, Logan!

1338
02:01:35,177 --> 02:01:36,872
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.

1339
02:01:37,346 --> 02:01:39,666
I'm gonna have to tell these men
to fire on these children.

1340
02:01:39,682 --> 02:01:40,979
You don't want that.

1341
02:01:41,183 --> 02:01:43,481
You can see the effects of
the serum are wearing off.

1342
02:01:43,686 --> 02:01:46,246
You will not survive further wounds.

1343
02:01:46,522 --> 02:01:48,046
Allow me to introduce myself.

1344
02:01:48,457 --> 02:01:49,457
I'm Zander Rice.

1345
02:01:50,626 --> 02:01:52,706
I believe you knew my father
on the Weapon X Program.

1346
02:01:52,862 --> 02:01:56,389
Yeah. He's the asshole
who put this poison in me.

1347
02:01:57,466 --> 02:01:58,899
Yes, he was one of them.

1348
02:02:00,336 --> 02:02:02,065
I think I might have killed him.

1349
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:04,497
I think you're right.

1350
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:06,200
Why don't you show some respect, mutie?

1351
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,168
You're lookin' at the man
who wiped out your kind.

1352
02:02:08,777 --> 02:02:10,642
My friend Donald overstates.

1353
02:02:11,714 --> 02:02:14,410
He makes it sound more
brutal than intended.

1354
02:02:14,617 --> 02:02:17,814
The goal was not to end mutant kind...

1355
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:19,282
but to control it.

1356
02:02:21,457 --> 02:02:24,125
I realized we needn't stop
perfecting what we eat and drink.

1357
02:02:24,326 --> 02:02:26,446
That we could use those products
to perfect ourselves.

1358
02:02:27,563 --> 02:02:30,261
To distribute gene therapy
discreetly through everything...

1359
02:02:30,466 --> 02:02:32,627
from sweet drinks to breakfast cereals.

1360
02:02:32,835 --> 02:02:33,927
And it worked.

1361
02:02:34,136 --> 02:02:36,604
Random mutancy went the way of polio.

1362
02:02:36,805 --> 02:02:38,125
We embarked on our next endeavor.

1363
02:02:38,307 --> 02:02:39,865
Growing mutants of your own.

1364
02:02:40,075 --> 02:02:41,175
- Precisely.
- Dangerous times, James.

1365
02:02:41,176 --> 02:02:42,176
You can't...

1366
02:02:42,578 --> 02:02:43,578
Argh!

1367
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:45,704
Argh!

1368
02:03:01,196 --> 02:03:02,196
Showtime, boy!

1369
02:03:38,901 --> 02:03:40,732
Get up, boy. Get up, boy!

1370
02:03:45,708 --> 02:03:46,868
He did that. Get up!

1371
02:04:00,255 --> 02:04:01,882
Laura! No!

1372
02:04:06,962 --> 02:04:07,962
Laura!

1373
02:04:55,444 --> 02:04:56,444
Please.

1374
02:05:31,346 --> 02:05:32,346
Ah!

1375
02:05:40,155 --> 02:05:41,155
Go.

1376
02:05:42,725 --> 02:05:43,725
Let's go.

1377
02:05:44,259 --> 02:05:45,259
Go.

1378
02:05:46,729 --> 02:05:48,196
Go, go, go!

1379
02:05:48,931 --> 02:05:51,126
Go! Get out of here! Go!

1380
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:56,963
Go. Go, go, go!

1381
02:06:01,410 --> 02:06:02,809
Go, go!

1382
02:06:03,045 --> 02:06:04,045
Go!

1383
02:06:04,713 --> 02:06:05,509
Run!

1384
02:06:05,714 --> 02:06:06,714
No!

1385
02:06:07,549 --> 02:06:08,982
No!

1386
02:06:46,655 --> 02:06:48,088
No, no. No.

1387
02:07:13,081 --> 02:07:14,742
Take your friends, and run.

1388
02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:16,110
No.

1389
02:07:16,852 --> 02:07:19,446
Run. They'll keep
coming and coming.

1390
02:07:19,655 --> 02:07:22,283
Listen, you don't have
to fight anymore.

1391
02:07:26,595 --> 02:07:28,620
Go, go.

1392
02:07:36,205 --> 02:07:38,230
Don't be what they made you.

1393
02:07:46,281 --> 02:07:48,442
Laura... Laura...

1394
02:07:52,888 --> 02:07:53,980
Daddy.

1395
02:08:03,465 --> 02:08:06,093
So, this is what it feels like.

1396
02:08:08,170 --> 02:08:09,170
No!

1397
02:08:17,045 --> 02:08:18,045
No!

1398
02:08:31,727 --> 02:08:32,727
Daddy.

1399
02:08:33,562 --> 02:08:34,562
Dad.

1400
02:09:06,495 --> 02:09:09,293
"A man has to be what he is, Joey.

1401
02:09:10,699 --> 02:09:12,326
"Can't break the mold.

1402
02:09:15,237 --> 02:09:17,705
"There's no living with a killing.

1403
02:09:18,874 --> 02:09:20,739
"There's no going back.

1404
02:09:22,945 --> 02:09:24,810
"Right or wrong, it's a brand.

1405
02:09:25,714 --> 02:09:27,579
"A brand that sticks.

1406
02:09:30,686 --> 02:09:32,984
"Now you run on home to your mother.

1407
02:09:34,222 --> 02:09:37,658
"You tell her everything's all right.

1408
02:09:39,261 --> 02:09:42,560
"There are no more guns in the valley."

1409
02:09:59,448 --> 02:10:01,416
Let's go.
We gotta move.

02:13:17,479 --> 02:13:20,880
<i>And at his feet they'll cast
their golden crown.</i>

1435
02:13:23,585 --> 02:13:25,917
<i>When the man comes around.</i>

1436
02:13:27,422 --> 02:13:32,018
<i>Whoever is unjust let
him be unjust still.</i>

1437
02:13:32,794 --> 02:13:37,026
<i>Whoever is righteous
let him be righteous still.</i>

1438
02:13:37,332 --> 02:13:41,860
<i>Whoever is filthy let
him be filthy still.</i>

1439
02:13:42,337 --> 02:13:45,465
<i>Listen to the words long written down.</i>

1440
02:13:48,076 --> 02:13:50,374
<i>When the man comes around.</i>

1441
02:13:52,147 --> 02:13:55,412
<i>Hear the trumpets hear the pipers.</i>

1442
02:13:56,651 --> 02:13:59,552
<i>One hundred million angels singin'</i>

1443
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:06,893
<i>Multitudes are marchin'
to the big kettle drum.</i>

1444
02:14:08,129 --> 02:14:11,292
<i>Voices callin', voices cryin'</i>

1445
02:14:13,034 --> 02:14:16,401
<i>Some are born an'some are dyin'</i>

1446
02:14:17,572 --> 02:14:21,872
<i>It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come.</i>

1447
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:26,371
<i>And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree.</i>

1448
02:14:27,449 --> 02:14:30,976
<i>The virgins are all
trimming their wicks.</i>

1449
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:36,416
<i>The whirlwind is in the thorn tree.</i>

1450
02:14:37,158 --> 02:14:40,559
<i>It's hard for thee to
kick against the pricks.</i>

1451
02:14:42,030 --> 02:14:45,898
<i>In measured hundredweight
and penny pound.</i>

1452
02:14:48,003 --> 02:14:50,130
<i>When the man comes around.</i>
