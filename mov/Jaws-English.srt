Larry, you won't
believe it.

00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,221
What kind of
a shark is that?

519
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,472
I don't know.

520
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,141
I think it's a mako.

521
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,475
It's got a deep throat,
Frank.

522
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,602
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

523
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:22,812
Tiger shark.

524
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:25,857
A What?

525
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,442
We can start
breathing again.

00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,735
Is Ben getting
plenty of pictures?

Oh, you bet he is.

00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:31,738
What is this
bite radius crap?

529
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,197
That is a big mouth.

530
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,241
You stuff your frigging
head in there, man,

531
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:38,327
and find out if
it's a man-eater.

532
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:44,834
All I'm saying is that
it may not be the shark.

533
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,085
It's just a slight...

Nice to meet you.

537
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,343
Terrific, huh, Mayor?

538
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:58,723
There are all kinds of
sharks in the waters.

539
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,017
Hammerheads, white
tips, blues, makos.

540
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,103
And the chances that these
bozos got the exact shark...

541
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:06,105
There are no other
sharks like this here.

542
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:08,107
It's 100-to-1.

543
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:12,820
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

544
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,740
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.

545
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,367
But the fact is, the bite
radius on this animal

546
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,912
is different than the
wounds on the victim.

547
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,082
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.

548
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,709
We all want to
be sure, okay?

549
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,419
What I want to do
is very simple.

550
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,297
The digestive system of
this animal is very slow.

551
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,507
Let's cut it open.

552
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,509
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

553
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,052
is bound to
still be in there.

554
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,095
And then we'll be sure.

555
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,145
It may be the only way
to confirm it.

556
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,564
Look, fellows,
let's be reasonable.

This is not
the time or the place

to perform some kind of a
half-assed autopsy on a fish.

559
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:59,534
And I am not going to stand here
and see that thing cut open

560

spill out all over the dock.

Yeah, I love them.

613
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:48,364
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat

614
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,199
and I went fishing
off of Cape Cod.

615
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,451
I hooked a soup and
as I was reeling it in

616
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:55,371
I hooked a 4.5 foot
baby thresher shark

617
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,081
who proceeded
to eat my boat.

618
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:02,211
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

619

He turned an inboard
into an outboard

620
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:07,091
scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

621
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,635
When I was on the beach,
I turned around

622
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,679
and actually saw my
boat being taken apart.

623

Ever since then, I have
been studying sharks

624

to go to the Institute tomorrow

have a shark problem here.

the shark was caught.

I heard it on the Cape station.

not the shark.

Not the shark that
killed Chrissie Watkins.

And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

knew what they were missing

00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,944
that a lot of these
attacks weren't reported?

supply is gone, right?
