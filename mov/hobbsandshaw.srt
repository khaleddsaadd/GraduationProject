00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,833
Yup. That's my brother.

178
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,214
Why don't you ever talk about Samoa?

179
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,675
Did something happen?

180
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,965
In life, things happen.

181
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,882
You may not want them to, but they do.

182
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,973
You just gotta do your best...

183
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,980
and move on.

184
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,233
And the fact of the matter is
I'm your family.

185
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,861
I'm your people. Me.

186
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,272
-And you're a whole lot.
-Oh, I am a whole lot.

187
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,691
-[chuckles]
-[Hobbs] Look at this. Perfect timing.

188
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,115
Oh, no, this is the mini.

189
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,827
-Yup.
-Thank you so much.

190
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,039
-Cheat day?
-Cheat day. Yeah.

191
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,247
Thank you so much.

192
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,173
Is that really necessary?

193
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,301
Come on! She's 71 years old.
What's the matter with you lot?

194
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,383
Sir, the prisoner will
only be allowed more leniency

195
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,799
when she proves
to be less of a security risk.

196
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,969
If someone leaves a back door open,
it's a bit daft not to try and use it.

197
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,513
What's daft is paying
one of the screws to leave it open

198
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,272
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut.

199
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,479
Yeah, well, my point still stands.

200
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,860
If you can't break out
of a shitty prison like this,

201
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,396
then you're seriously slipping, Mum.

202
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,985
You cheeky bugger.

203
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,241
Speaking of breaking out,
where's my birthday cake?

204
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,823
The one with the ﬁle in it?
They're baking it.

205
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,705
Who wants a bloody ﬁle?
What I want is a nice little bit of C-4.

206
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,335
Listen, if you want out of here,
just say the word. l'll handle it.

207
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,244
Oh, Decks,
I'm just having a bit of fun really.

208
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,961
Being banged up doesn‘t bother me.
I quite enjoy the peace and quiet.

209
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,377
You know, nice walk,
bit of reading, loads of sudoku.

210
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,671
It's like being retired. Love it.

211
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,925
Now listen,
have you spoken with your sister?

212
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,434
You know I haven't, Mum.

213
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,890
-Give me your hand.
-There she goes.

214
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,977
I mean, you and your sister,
you used to be inseparable.

215
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,392
What happened, Decks?
What happened between you?

216
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:21,358
I remember you, Owen, and Hattie
playing out in the backyard.

217
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,366
Your little games, your little grifts.
Robbing banks.

218
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,402
You used to give
your little scams code names.

219
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,490
Do you remember?

220
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,871
-Oh, what was that one?
-The "Keith Moon."

221
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,001
[Magdalene] Yeah, that’s right. It was
called the "Keith Moon" because it--

222
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,630
It involved lots of explosive percussion
and permanent ear damage.

223
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,714
J‘ Yeah! J‘

224
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,714
[laughs]

225
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,303
That's my boy.

226
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,468
No wonder we left the family business.

227
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,806
She loves you, you know?

228
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,722
All you gotta do
is pick up the phone, Decks.

229
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,517
Look at me. You're her big brother.

230
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,526
She looks up to you.

231
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,902
Used to.

232
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:09,987
Well, one day, ljust hope
that I walk through that door

233
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,995
and | see the two of you sitting there.

234
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,577
How many years you got left?

235
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,579
Two, with good behavior.

236
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,744
-So how many, really?
-Four.

237
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,914
Well, you know what they say.

238
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,716
"Never say 'never.'"

239
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,964
[guard] Time's up.

240
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,587
You behave yourself.

241
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,802
Will do. Love you, darling. [kisses]

242
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,182
Love you too. [kisses]

243
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,270
[Magdalene laughs]

244
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,824
-All right.
-[man] Lucas Rebecca Hobbs.

245
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,407
I haven't seen you in forever.

246
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,993
-"Rebecca"?
-Do you even age? How long's it been?

247
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,248
-Six months.
-Time ﬂies.

248
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,956
-When we're apart.
-What is your skin care regimen?

249
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,872
Because you look
like a young Shirley Temple.

250
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,290
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-Daddy, who is this guy?

251
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,256
Well, this guy is Locke.

252
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,346
And he works for the CIA.

253
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,222
-Your dad and I are old friends.
-We're not old friends.

254
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,348
Actually, we‘re...

255
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,593
We're best friends. Here's the half heart.

256
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,977
I don't know what that is.

257
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,139
-We got some ink together as well.
-We did not get ink together.

258
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,807
-Oh, we didn't?
-No, we did not.

259
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,896
-Interesting. I seem to remember...
-We never got ink together.

260
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,813
...getting a little something like this
at one point on my body.

261
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,982
-Jesus.
-Christ, I miss our playful banter.

262
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,650
You have one minute
to tell me what you want

263
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,068
before I knock one of your lungs loose.

264
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,907
You and l are after the same thing.

265
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,038
Say hello to the CT-17 virus.

266
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,201
It's a programmable bioweapon
of biblical proportions.

267
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,744
Affectionately code-named "the Snowflake."

268
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,958
What does the Snowflake do?

269
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,874
Oh, nothing much.
Just liquefies your internal organs.

270
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,714
Basically turns your body
into a giant bag of hot soup.

271
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,969
She is nine!

272
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,470
-Seen worse.
-Where?

273
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,926
Game of Thrones. Janet's house.

274
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,931
-I‘ve never heard of it.
-A Lannister always pays his debts.

275
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,808
You're never going over there again.

276
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,936
But there's a new
wrinkle in the case, Rebecca.

277
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,769
The specifics... are all in the brief.

278
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,150
There you go.

279
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,569
-She's ready, Becca.
-She's nine.

280
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,697
This is the only unit of CT-17
in existence,

281
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:14,327
and this Snowﬂake is now in the hands
of a rogue MI6 operative in London.

282
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,908
Dad, are all spies that pretty?

283
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,536
No. She is unusually attractive.

284
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,075
And deadly.

285
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,212
Last night she was part of an MI6 team
tasked with securing the virus.

286
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,873
She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.

287
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,418
She stabbed one guy in the chest
using a brick.

288
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,007
Do you know how hard that is?

289
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,842
To stab someone using a brick?

290
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,098
-Get to the point.
-The point is there's no sharp edge.

291
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,726
How did she get an entire brick
into another person's chest?

292
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,307
She either had to be really strong

293
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,769
or the other person had to have been,
like, born without, like, bones.

294
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,400
-Get to the larger point.
-She stole the Snowflake.

295
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,528
-She went totally off-grid.
-Who's this?

296
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,564
That's the scientist
we believe created the virus.

297
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,402
Great. Where do I find him?

298
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,989
He's off-grid too.
Impossible to ﬁnd. Maybe dead.

299
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,074
-You're very helpful, Locke.
-And you're the world's best tracker.

300
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,864
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

301
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,250
Oh, no, no, no. I'm DSS, you're CIA.
I don't work for you.

302
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,912
Your boss loaned you out.
You do now, dickface.

303
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,250
-What'd you just call me?
-Hey, hey, hey!

304
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,790
Let's just settle down. All right?

305
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,583
We've already got
a black site running in London.

306
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,343
There's an operative there.
Top of his game. He'll be your contact.

307
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,050
I don't need anybody else. I work alone.

308
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,260
We got bigger problems
than your fragile ego,

309
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,302
or the fact that a moment ago
I most deﬁnitely shit my pants.

310
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,355
The entire world
is at stake here, all right?

311
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,016
This thing gets out, we're looking at
a lot of liqueﬁed organs,

312
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,025
and I mean, like, everywhere.

313
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,027
And notjust yours and mine.

314
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,907
Uh... He knows I can see him, right?

315
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,820
He knows nothing, Jon Snow.

316
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,330
[Sam chuckles]

317
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,831
So what's it gonna be, Becky?

318
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,242
You gonna partner up?

319
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,582
-I‘m in.
-Of course you are.

320
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,963
Do you remember what I told you in Rwanda?

321
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,792
-"Stop watching me sleep."
-I said:

322
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,133
-"We are not friends at all."
-We're best friends.

323
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,173
-And to watch your back.
-Wash your back, yeah.

324
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,762
-Oh, I remember.
-Watch your back.

325
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,141
Lot of back. I got you.

326
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,519
Hey. Same old Hobbs, huh?

327
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,644
Same old Locke.

328
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,391
All right. Who's on the case?

329
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,442
[man speaking indistinctly over PA]

330
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,864
-Mr. Shaw.
-Whatever it is, I ain't buying it.

331
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,744
You don't know what I'm selling,
or who I am.

332
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,825
CIA.

333
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,617
-How could you--
-Sunglasses, cloudy day, sensible shoes.

334
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,375
I have fallen arches, and I don't have
a lot of choice in what I--

335
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,789
Anyway, I'm Agent Loeb, and I need
to talk to you about our shared interest.

336
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,877
How'd you find me?

337
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,964
I got a tip from an acquaintance of yours:
Mr. Nobody.

338
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,128
Mr. Nobody.

339
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,300
Little joke for you, Loeb.

340
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,263
What do CIA operatives
and baseballs have in common?

341
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,598
People cheer when you hit them with a bat.

342
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,683
No.

343
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,020
They are two things
I don't give a toss about.

344
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,564
That works too.

345
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,114
The weapon she‘s stolen
is not like anything we've ever seen.

346
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,530
It‘s a programmable disease
that can target any DNA sequence

347
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,701
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.

348
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,041
If MI6 ﬁnds her,
they’re gonna treat her like a traitor.

349
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,297
[man on phone]
We need you to surrender the virus.

350
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,716
What is your location?

351
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,670
What, you think I killed them?

352
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,682
[Loeb] But if you help us ﬁnd her,
if you bring us the virus,

353
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,641
we ’l/ grant her immunity.

354
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,313
We've set up a black site here in London.

355
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,441
You‘ve got everything you could need
at your disposal,

356
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,102
and we're bringing in an asset
from the States to assist you.

357
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,566
I don't need anybody.

358
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,197
Maybe not, Mr. Shaw.

359
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:39,903
But she does.

360
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,451
-My guy's in.
-My guy's in too.

361
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,124
Is your guy gonna freak out
when he ﬁnds out who my guy is?

362
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,035
Didn't theyjust do a job
together in New York?

363
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,204
Didn't they just destroy
the DSS field office in LA

364
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,838
by throwing each other through it?

365
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,626
I don't know. Look,
I don't know about your guy, but my guy?

366
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,919
He's gonna get this.
He's gonna pull this off. You know why?

367
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,463
We've been best friends
our whole goddamn lives.

368
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,429
Well, my guy beat the shit out of me
at a bar in Krakow 17 years ago,

369
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,140
and he doesn't even remember me.

370
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,646
So we all have our histories.

371
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,431
Anyway, it's the fate of the world here.

372
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,565
It's the fate of the world.

373
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,693
The planet's population is in their hands.

374
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,853
Serious stuff.

375
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,023
You‘d think they'd be able to put aside
any petty rivalries to save the world.

376
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,236
-Mm. Mm.
-[slurping]

377
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,325
-No fucking way.
-No fucking way.

378
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,828
I'm not working with this guy.
I've been there, done that.

379
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,660
The minute he gets involved,
you can kiss goodbye to any ﬁnesse,

380
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,121
because She-Hulk here
only knows how to smash.

381
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,661
And Mr. Arson here
only knows how to blow shit up.

382
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,045
-The fact is...
-And the fact is...

383
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,752
-no offense...
-oh, no offense...

384
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,837
-this guy's a real asshole.
-this guy's a real asshole.

385
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,004
That's "sumbitch" in your native tongue.

386
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,298
That'd be "wanker“ in your native tongue.

387
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,309
Are you ﬁnished blubbering?
You sound like a giant tattooed baby.

388
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,096
I'm not listening to this horseshit.
I got a job to do.

389
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,600
Tell your mom I said hi.
Actually, I'll tell her myself.

390
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,565
Don‘t you ever talk about my mother.
I'll put your head through that wall.

391
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,357
Secondly, I'll have this job done while
you're still putting on your baby oil.

392
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,525
Good luck, slick.

393
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,535
-[snaps fingers]
-That's it. You just reminded me.

394
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,617
That's exactly why
I hate working with you.

395
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,616
It's your voice.

396
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,079
It‘s your nasally, prepubescent,
Harry Potter voice.

397
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,215
Every time you speak,
just imagine this for a second,

398
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,378
it‘s like dragging my balls
across shattered glass.

399
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,547
-And it hurts.
-Well, for me,

400
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,633
it's not your voice.

401
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,558
It's your face.

402
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,095
Your big, stupid face.

403
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,810
Looking at it makes me feel

404
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,727
like God is projectile vomiting
right in my eyes.

405
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,940
And it burns.

406
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,906
It really burns.

407
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,486
What you gonna do now?
Throw a bit of furniture?

408
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,201
For your information, I was gonna
take this chair and turn it sideways

409
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,491
and shove it right down your throat.

410
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,876
Of course you are,
'cause that's your answer to everything.

411
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,833
Smash a hole through every problem
in a massive truck.

412
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,794
-That's not gonna work here.
-I think it'll work fine.

413
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,210
Guys, why don't you two take a seat
and we'll talk through this?

414
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,637
Me and you? Us? I've been down this road.

415
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,142
It's a total waste of time.

416
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,644
For once, I couldn't agree with you more.

417
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,304
Yeah? Well, I'm doing this my way.

418
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,642
If anyone's got a problem with that,
I suggest you come out here and stop me.

419
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,276
I'm not going in there.

420
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,607
Well, I'm not going in there.

421
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,272
Smart lads.

422
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:37,376
All right, now that we got rid of
that fun sponge, we can get to work.

423
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,288
I want you to pull up every CCTV camera
around central London.

424
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,377
We already have two dozen agents
scouring footage.

425
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,712
Don't you talk back to me, Opie. Uh-uh.

426
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,469
I just care about the coverage.
I ain't gonna ask you again. Pull it up.

427
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,925
Now zoom in on the area of the heist.

428
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,765
Now invert it. Highlight the areas
that the cameras don't cover.

429
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,647
She's smart.

430
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,697
She just killed her entire team
and stole a deadly virus.

431
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,608
She ain't waiting around for no picture.

432

Got a lot of nasty people looking for you.

00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,838
Are you nasty?

473
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,129
Well, it all depends on what happens
in the next 30 seconds.

474
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,134
Promises, promises.

475
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,465
[door opens]

476
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:03,390
So here's how it's gonna go down.
We do this the hard way or the easy way.

477
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,057
-[scoffs] Are you serious?
-I am.

478
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,316
-Really?
-Yes.

479
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,399
-Hmm. Well, it's a tough decision.
-No, it's really not.

480
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,813
You want me to freeze?

481
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,657
Let me see your hands.

482
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,488
Fine.

483
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,621
But you're not gonna like what's in 'em.

484
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,708
-Think I made up my mind.
-You seem like a smart woman.

485
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:24,789
lam.

486
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,078
The hard way.

487
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,838
[grunting, groaning]

488
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,294

Stop!

Jeez.

Bet you wish
you didn't take it easy on me now.

504
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,756
I wish a lot of things right now.

505
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,270
You're going to go to sleep now.
It's all gonna seem like a bad dream.

506
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,984
It's more like a nightmare.

507
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,819
This whole thing is a nightmare.

508
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,904
All right,
let‘s me and you have a little chat.

-[panting]

512
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,851
[woman] The director called.
He ordered a new baseline for you.

513
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,936
He has everything ready for you
in medical.

514
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:58,106
[director]
Perfection is a painful process, Brixton,

515
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,405
in ourselves
and in the pursuit of a perfect world.

516
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,489
Humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself.

517
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,168
Eteon will carve out all human weakness

518
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,750
and replace it with mechanical perfection.

519
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,336
And you will lead the way.

520
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,553
I'm gonna ask you a question.

521
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,422
It's not what you think it is.

522
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,174
Do you like to dance?

523
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,342
What, the Electric Slide?

524
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,762
The Macarena? No, I don't.

525
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,182
No, no, no,
I was thinking about... the tango.

526
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,977
-Where it takes two.
-Yeah, don't know that one.

527
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,485
Must be different generations.

528
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,318
[laughs]

529
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:44,701
Yeah, well, either way, the music started,
so let's see what kind of rhythm you have.

530
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,738
-Where‘s the virus?
-Look, I told you,

531
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,782
-I‘ve no idea what you're talking about.
-Okay, that hurt.

532
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,951
You just stepped on my toes,
that didn't feel good.

533
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,960
Let's try it again.
I think you're better than that.

534
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,167
-Where's the virus?
-I didn't ask to dance.

535
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,956
And why should I talk to you?
You're not CIA.

536
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,216
No? How do you know that?

537
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,501
Where shall I start?

538
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,716
There's two types of CIA agents.
Intelligence and espionage.

539
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,551
Those guys over there
can barely lift a pencil.

540
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,137
That's what intelligence agents look like.

541
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,302
You look like you could
pick up a building.

542
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,137
But espionage is about blending in
and about being subtle,

543
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:16,230
and there is nothing subtle about you.

544
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,727
Yeah.

545
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,360
That's good.

546
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,068
-I‘m impressed.
-I didn't kill anybody.

547
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,232
I know you didn't.

548
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,238
How do you know that, then?

549
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,620
Because you can learn a lot about somebody
when you fight them.

550
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,249
And when we fought,
you weren't fighting to kill me.

551
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,830
You were fighting to run away.

552
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,788
But either way, the world thinks that
you're a murderer and a thief,

553
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,127
so you're not going anywhere
or getting any goddamn phone call

554
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,508
until you give me some real answers.

555
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,089
You have no idea what is happening here.

556
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,674
-Then tell me. Help me understand.
-I can't.

557
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,634
-You're wasting my time.
-I can't either-- You're wasting time!

558
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,425
Virus gets in the wrong hands, that's it.
It's game over.

559
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,971
[alarm ringing]

560
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,682
[chuckles]

561
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,942
Does that mean it's time for curls?

562
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,733
Just like the CIA,
always flexing the wrong muscle.

563
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,526
You know, the mind
is the strongest muscle in the body.

564
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,535
Maybe you should try
exercising that a little bit more.

565
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,954
“There's more wisdom in your body
than in your deepest philosophies.“

566
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,835
Let me guess. That Bruce Lee?

567
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,916
[chuckles] No, Nietzsche.

568
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,839
'Cause I'm flexing this.

569
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:22,962
And all of that.

570
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,761
Come here.

571
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,844
If she moves, I want you to shoot her.

572
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,928
Yeah, he can't shoot me.

573
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,226
-Yeah, not allowed.
-In the face.

574
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,478
You can‘t. You'd go to prison.

575
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,185
-You can shoot her right in the face.
-No, you can't. You'd go to prison. Sorry.

576
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,816
I want you to shoot her
two times right in that face.

577
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,731
-Okay?
-Yeah.

578
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,698
[Sam on phone] Hi, Dad.

579
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,203
Did you catch the hot spy lady?

580
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,490
Come on. It's me.
I catch everybody I hunt.

581
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,332
How long have you been doing this?

582
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,003
'Cause you seem... new.

583
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,459
[groaning]

584
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,922
She's actually quite annoying.

585
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,214
You know, Dad,
sometimes people annoy each other

586
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,633
when they're actually, like, ﬂirting.

587
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:13,846
Where'd you hear that from?

588
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:20,311
Okay, look, me and the spy lady,
we're not flirting, all right?

589
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,475
Zero chemistry.

590
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,268
[groaning]

591
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,070
[tires screech]

[engine revs, shuts off]

593
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,457
I don't know.

594
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,369
When you saw her photo,
you definitely gave the eyebrow.

595
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,787
What eyebrow?

596
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,502
-You know, Dad, that thing that you do.
-What thing?

597
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,467
-I don't do that.
-Yes, you do.

598
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,174
No, I definitely don't do that.
I don't even know what you're doing.

599
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,259
That’s the silliest thing I've ever seen.

600
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,265
Let me get going,
I got business to take care of.

601
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,723
I‘ll see you when I get home, okay?
I love you.

602
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,887
Love you.

603
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,099
Hey, one more thing.

604
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,686
-[Sam laughs]
-[chuckles]

605

606
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,060
Goddamn it.

607
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,565
[grunting]

608
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,033
This is not the dance
you wanna do with me, woman.

609
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,289
-Oh, really?
-I eat bullets all day long.

610
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,121
Oh, for breakfast and lunch?
'Cause it's dinnertime.

611
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,580
I‘ll count down for you. Three...

612
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,624
-Two...
-[Shaw] Hobbs.

613
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,664
-[analyst] Freeze.
-Put that down.

614
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,673
Get your greasy
sausage fingers off of her.

615
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,584
-What are you doing here?
-Saving you.

616
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,632
I don't need to be saved.

617
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,048
No, no. This is my house and your
goddamn girlfriend ain‘t going anywhere.

618
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,808
-That's disgusting.
-[Shaw] "Girlfriend"?

619
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,559
That is my sister.

620
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,432
Bullshit. She's too good-looking
to be your sister.

621
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,817
Very funny.
Hat, there are people after you.

622
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,942
Believe me, I know that.

623
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,195
It's gonna stay that way
unless you tell me where that virus is.

624
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,654
Listen to me, pinhead. She's gonna die
if I don't get her out of here right now!

625
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,943
We're all gonna die if
she doesn't tell us where that weapon is.

626
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,578
Actually, everyone's gonna die
'cause I am the virus!

627
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,656
It's embedded in capsules.

628
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,290
I need to find a way to get them out.

629
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,373

00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,844
-Now or never.
-I‘m more of a now type of guy.

635
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,853
-On my three.
-Sure.

636
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,560
One, two, three.

637
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,726
No one tells me what to do.

Deckard Shaw. It‘s been a long time.

646
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,040
Good to see you, Brixton.

647
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,960
-I think you're out of bullets there, son.
-Lucky for you, I am.

648
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,253
Yeah.

649
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,422
-Nice suit.
-[Brixton] Bulletproof.

650
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,215
-State of the art.
-[Shaw] Could've done with that

651
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,554
the last time I put a bullet in ya.

652
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,094
No, actually, it was three bullets.

653
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,389
Two to the chest, one to the head.
Just like they taught us. Do you remember?

654
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,728
It's a shame you didn't join Eteon.

655
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,142
You could‘ve had all this, my friend.

656
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,230
-"Friend"?
-Yeah.

657
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,319
-You're not the man I knew.
-No. I am way better.

658
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,734
I'm the future of mankind.

Stop!

00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,891
Hattie, get in the car.

665
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,229
We're all going.

666
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,193
Not you.

667
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,692
Just the girl.

A big brother lecture now, really? Huh?

680
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,146

He was gonna take it.

You wanna tell me just what in the
fresh turkey hell we're dealing with here?

704
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,848
Long story.

705
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,889
He's a ghost. Supposed to be dead.

706
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,441
Eight years ago,
I put a bullet through his brain.

707

I don't think he's gonna make it.

00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,450
I don't think he can see
over the steering wheel.

I'm gonna save your life again.

Update.

720
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,794
I've hacked the mainframe
of every news agency and outlet.

721
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:25,999
How many do we control?

722
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,256
Hundred and seventy-four broadcasts,
2,000 odd.

723
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,838
Double it.
I want 100% control of this story.

724
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,969
-Standard frame job.
-No, standard will not do.

725
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,550
I need something special for these guys.

726
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,339
So listen up. Narrative:

727
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:41,102
Hobbs, Shaw, big guy, little guy,
have been ID'd.

728
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,639
They've been blamed
for the recent attacks on the CIA.

729
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,604
They shared a prison cell
where they hatched a plan

730
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,236
to start their reign of terror.

731
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,651
Just got real.

732
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,781
-[Hattie] Who the hell are these guys?
-[Shaw] Eteon.

733
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,994
They're a secret tech cult, with
a mercenary army and plenty of dark money.

734
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:06,165
And delusions of saving the world
by augmenting the human race.

735
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,249
That's it.

736
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,129
Apparently they control the media as well.

737
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,166
Heard rumors about these people.

738
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,959
Everybody thinks they're a myth.

739
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,342
[Shaw] I've seen it firsthand
how real they are.

740
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,258
If you don't fit into their plans,
you've already dug your own grave.

741
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,099
All right, let's get to
the nearest lockdown facility--

742
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,685
Hey, no. You don't get it, do you?

743
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,598
Brixton's a tier-one assassin.
Best I've ever seen. I know him.

744
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,892
He ain't never gonna stop
until he gets that virus.

745
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:32,654
And besides, that's my sister.
Family business.

746
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,236
Is your name Shaw? No.
Then she's going nowhere with you.

747
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,696
When it comes to the fate of the world,
it becomes my business.

748
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,111
I don't care if she's your sister,
that woman ain't going anywhere--

749
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,283
-Where are you going?
-I‘m going away.

750
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,119
I don't have time for your alpha male shit
right now. You're both idiots.

751
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,035
You clearly can't work together
and so you're absolutely useless to me.

752
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,129
So I'm gonna go find the man who can
help me get this thing out of my system.

753
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,789
-See ya.
-[Hobbs] You mean this man?

754
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,668
I was tracking him before the attack.

755
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,262
He's hard to find,
but I think I got a hell of a lead.

756
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,513
Russian newspaper.

757
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,844
Not just any old paper.

758
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,517

in London that sells that.

764
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,084

765
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,662
How complicated for you.

766
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,542
Not really.

767
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,459
He's also working with DSS, Luke Hobbs.

768
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,128
Hobbs. We have a history.

769
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,967
They're formidable.

770
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,556
Small fry.

771
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:45,685
I'll eliminate the two of them.
Get the asset back ASAP.

772
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,266
You get the girl,

773
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,354
extract the virus
and reprogram it for phase one.

774
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,109
We use that weapon to eliminate the weak

775
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,237
and anyone who would get in our way.

776
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,232
We ’re building
the perfect system, Brixton.

777
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,199
Turn them.

778
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,363
"Turn 'em"?

779
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,077
Sorry, I don't follow.

780
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:11,536
I want them turned.
I want them working for the cause.

781
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,624
Understood?

782
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,501
They can't be turned.

783
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,958
What makes you so certain?

784
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,419
The last time we asked,
I got shot in the face.

785
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,929
That makes me very certain.

786
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:25,057
So, I suggest that
we take another approach.

787
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,389
-Which is why--
-l'm not asking, Brixton.

788
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,679
You show them the consequences of refusal.

789
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,895
Or perhaps I'll show them to you.

790
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,024
Is that a threat?

791
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,862
I'd remember who you're reliant on
for your survival.

792
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,031
All for the cause.

793
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,614
Look, honey, I have to talk to you about
something. It's very important right now.

794
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,159
Remember how we spoke about
what would happen if things went sideways?

795
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:54,750
We called it a "code red."
Well, it's happening.

796
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,164
Is there anything I can do?

797
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,674
You need to stay home.
You're gonna be safe there.

798
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,462
As a matter of fact, we've got the CIA
listening in on this call right now.

799
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,638
Watch this. Hi, Locke.

800
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:08,302
Everybody's safe, everybody‘s great.
I'm actually at our old diner here.

801
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,811
It's super weird being here
without you guys.

802
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,856
Think it's closed.

803
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,229
Thank you, brother.

804
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,938
Honey, I've already talked to Aunt Lisa.
She knows exactly what to do.

805
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,822
I’m gonna be home as soon as I can.

806
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,904
-Love you.
-I love you back.

807
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,407
Goodbye.

808
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,749
Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw.

809
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,786
While Hobbs is an agent in the American--

810
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,876
Tell us everything you know about this.

811
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:39,757
My God.

812
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,010
-When were you exposed?
-[Hattie] About 30 hours ago.

813
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,546
Then the capsules containing
the virus are still intact.

814
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,885
So we need to neutralize it.

815
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,969
No, it is not that easy.

816
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:52,012
It's not programmed to any DNA sequence.
It's fatal to everyone.

817
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,056
In 42 hours, the capsules will dissolve,
and she will be infected.

818
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,270
Then the virus will go airborne.

819
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,357
We are talking global contamination
within a week.

820
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,442
Why in the hell
would you create something like that?

821
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,732
-Because I thought I was one of them.
-Eteon.

822
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,697
They told me they wanted
to save the world through science.

823
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,203
I believed in their cause.

824
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,536
I developed the Snowflake
to be a carrier for vaccines,

825
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,200
a panacea for the whole world.

826
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,586
But they redeveloped it
into a programmable apocalypse.

827
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:22,342
To attack the weakest of us. Those not
worthy of Eteon's vision of the future.

828
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,251
For a scientist,
you seem incredibly stupid.

829
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,593
Well, I'm a two-times Nobel Prize winner,
but who's counting?

830
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,681
All right, you said the virus is
programmable. So... reprogram it.

831
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,720
I can't reprogram it in a host.

832
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,263
Just tell us how to
get this thing out from me.

833
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,977
Well, there are two options.

834
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,895
And the first is easy.

835
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,185
-Go.
-Finally.

836
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,774
-You kill her.
-Excuse me?

837
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,028
And burn the body, of course.

838
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,359
-Of course.
-Of course.

839
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,739
No, I mean really burn it.

840
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:46,945
-Really burn it.
-To ash.

841
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,985
-To ash?
-Beyond all recognition.

842
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,404
Let's assume that that's not an option,
shall we, genius?

843
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,118
Yeah, it doesn't work for us.
Option number two.

844
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,874
There is a machine that could
preserve her life and extract the virus.

845
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,410
That should've been option number one.

846
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,419
Because it's impossible to get to.

847
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,797
We'll decide what's impossible.
Where is it?

848
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,382
A secret dark-tech complex
fortiﬁed by an army

849
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,093
in the most godforsaken
part of the planet.

850
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,133
But if you go there,
all three of you will die.

851
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,349
So basically what you're saying is:
she dies no matter what.

852
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,523
Well, who needs a drink?

853
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,809
I know just the place.

854
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,866
J‘ I'll keep you alive J‘

855
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,952
I Keep you alive I

856
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,745
J‘ They’ll be talking about you
Long after you die J‘

857
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,378
Wow, look at all these.

858
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,043
[Hobbs]
Somebody's overcompensating.

859
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,801
If anything, I'm under-compensating.

860
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,510
And a teeny-tiny one. Just your size.

861
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,384
[Shaw] Used it for a job over in Italy.

862
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,726
Shame we didn't need
a weightlifting bus driver.

863
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,682
Would've given you a call.

864
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:01,975
[chuckles]

865
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:05,987
I I'll keep you alive, keep you alive J‘

866
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:09,775
J‘ They’ll be talking about you
Long after you die... J‘

867
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,862
Drink?

868
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,444
Yeah, I'll take a little one.

869
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,863
I Keep you alive I

870
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,781
J‘ They’ll be talking about you J‘

871
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,076
J‘ Long after you die I

872
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,962
J‘ Long after you die I

873
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,046
I'll write to someone in Moscow.
An old friend.

874
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,930
Yeah, we have a long history.

875
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,262
She and her crew are paying a visit
to some locals.

876
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,098
Particular Russian criminal element.

877
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,854
-They have things that we're gonna need.
-Considering your history with friends,

878
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,310
how many bullets you put
in this one's head?

879
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,851
They can set us up with gear,
and I don't hear any other ideas.

880
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:48,112
We know getting out of this country
is gonna be extremely difficult.

881
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:51,149
We have every major intelligence agency
already hunting us down.

882
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,660
And there's the fact that you disgraced
MI6 when you betrayed your team.

883
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,578
Don‘t believe everything they tell you.

884
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,206
Smile.

885
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,211
[camera shutter clicks]

886
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,261
No, regular back channels
aren‘t gonna work this time.

887
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,843
We're gonna have to
do our best to blend in.

888
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,223
[Hattie] Hide in plain sight.

889
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,429
-That's why we'll be flying commercial.
-Commercial?

890
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,515
-We‘re gonna get spotted too easy at--
-[camera shutter clicks]

891
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,814
Don't worry that pea-sized brain.
I handled it.

892
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,850
Cloned our cell phone signals
around the world.

893
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,894
Should buy us at least 48 hours.

894
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,562
We'll pick up new gear
when we get to Moscow.

895
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,480
Should get us past the wandering eyes
at the airport.

896
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,775
This is probably the only thing
that's gonna fit.

897
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,403
Fit what, a Smurf?

898
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,368
I think that's one of my old ones.

899
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,159
I apologize in advance
if it's a little loose around the balls.

900
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,916
Okay. What do we got, tough guy? Come on.

901
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,253
[Shaw] I've created new identities
and altered your biometric profiles

902
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,213
so the airport scanners don't recognize
your faces or your ﬁngerprints.

903
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,800
You're Sarah Atkins.
You work in insurance.

904
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,929
Hello.

905
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,010
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

906
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,644
[Shaw] I'm Franz Gruber.

907
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,524
I'm a freelance architect,
avid mountain climber,

908
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,434
and a part-time ski instructor.

909
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:15,111
-Thank you.
-And you, you're Michael Oxmaul.

910
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,820
"Mike Oxmaul."

911
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,829
I go by Michael.

912
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,292
-[officer] Freeze! Stop, sir! Stop there!
-[officer 2] Stay right where you are!

913
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,332
-Stay there!
-lt's Mike. It's Mike Oxmaul.

914
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,047
It's not small. And my name's Michael.

915
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,337
They've stopped him for what, exactly?

916
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,224
Whatever it is, it's gonna involve
rubber gloves and a body cavity search.

917
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:41,304
Let's go.

918
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,595
[dog barking]

919
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,604
Hands on your head, Oxmaul.

920
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,398
[Hattie] Can't believe you did that.

921
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,157
He was gonna slow us down.

922
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,321
We can't pull this off. We both know it.

923
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,657
It's bad enough
I got this thing in my blood

924
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,120
that's gonna kill me and everyone else,

925
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,331
but were you seriously gonna break
this mysterious machine

926
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,996
out of some
high-security death virus complex

927
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,711
and magically get it to work?

928
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,092
-Frankly, that sounds completely--
-You still wear that silly thing?

929
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,716
Didn't know you still had that.

930
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,090
Put the pin back in.

931
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,676
You haven't changed.

932
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,394
Wish I could say the same about you.

933
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,434
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

934
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,108
We're gonna make this work.
It's what we do.

935
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,531
And what if we don't?

936
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,369
-What if the only option is for you to--
-It's not happening.

937
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,620
Hi, I'm here. I'm Michael.

938
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,087
Hi, yeah.

939
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,581
Hello. All right.

940
00:50:56,136 --> 00:51:00,379
Oh, yeah, let's see. Where's my seat?

941
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,844
F-one, F-two...

942
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,138
F you.

943
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,978
Hey.

944
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,811
You are an asshole.

945
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,562
You were quicker than I thought.

946
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,446
Yup. Because I have
a secret weapon.

947
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,107
People actually like me.

948
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,027
You wouldn‘t understand that
because you don't have any friends.

949
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,745
I love your babushka.

950
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,293
[dog barking in distance]

951
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,185
[gaSpSI

952
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,577
Couldn't have booked an emergency row
for a little bit more legroom?

953
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,459
Not everybody has hobbit legs like you.

954
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:16,247
Hey, look, in case you didn‘t realize,
I couldn't give a damn about your comfort.

955
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,256
So why don't you be a good elephant,

956
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:22,136
suck up another kilo of peanuts,
put your chair back and relax?

957
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,138
Listen, don't ever tell me to relax.
Don't tell me to do anything.

958
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:26,640
Any time you ever say anything,

959
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,222
it makes me want to take my boot
and shove it so far up your ass,

960
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,011
you're gonna be
spitting out Shoelaces all week.

961
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,101
Hey, you know what the problem is?

962
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,108
I‘ll tell you the problem. This job.

963
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,939
This job requires stealth.

964
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,481
And you... look at you.

965
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:45,993
I mean, granted, it's not yourfault.
But you're too obvious.

966
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:50,281
You stick out. Like balls on a bulldog.

967
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,041
Dangling down in all the wrong places.

968
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,702
Seemingly harmless.

969
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,882
And the next thing you know,
they're trying to impregnate your sister.

970
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,542
[chuckles] What?

971
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,845
-Impregnate your sister?
-You heard.

972
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,381
Oh...

973
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,054
Now I get it.

974
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:14,063
You do? Good. I'm glad. Yeah, I'm glad.

975
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,723
-I‘m very glad.
-You actually think that

976
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,267
I'm going through all this effort,
on this mission,

977
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,483
trying to save the world,
by the way, for a fourth time,

978
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,113
because I'm really good at it.

979
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,446
You think I‘m going through all of this
just so I can do the horizontal-hula,

980
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,531
sexy, sexy time with your sister?

981
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,912
Not all. Most.

982
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:34,826
Let me break it down for you, Frodo.
This ain't 1955 anymore, all right?

983
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,041
Despite the fact that that girl sleeping
right there is related to you,

984
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,082
she‘s still one of the toughest,
baddest, most capable women

985
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,251
I've ever encountered in my entire life.

986
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,636
And if she chooses to look the way

987
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,515
of this big, brown,

988
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:55,556
well-endowed, tattooed
mountain of a man, then guess what.

989
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,357
I'm gonna let her climb this mountain

990
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:03,146
over and over and over again.

991
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,813
You stay away from her.

992
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,484
I see what you're doing.
You think I‘m stupid?

993
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:10,949
Of course I think you‘re stupid.
But you know what? I'll do you a favor.

994
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,614
I'll knock that dumb right out of
your skull. You just say the word, jack.

995
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,702
You know what I wanna do?

996
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:19,371
I wanna do an Irish jig
on your arse-ugly face at 30,000 feet.

997
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,833
-Oh, 30,000 feet.
-Yeah.

998
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,339
-So you wanna dance right now?
-Yeah.

999
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,716
The only thing holding you back
is air and opportunity.

1000
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,969
[inhales deeply] And there goes the air.

1001
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,595
-Bring it on, Don Ho.
-"Don Ho"?

1002
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,881
That's enough! Hey, cut it out.

1003
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,140
Both of y‘all, cut it out.

1004
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,347
Oh, see? You woke up the air marshal.

1005
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,727
You woke the air marshal.

1006
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,764
-How‘d you know I was the air marshal?
-Unaccompanied.

1007
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,727
-Late boarding the plane.
-Aisle seat.

1008
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,233
-Golf shirt.
-Golf shirt.

1009
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,399
Let's just call that an educated guess.

1010
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,989
Air Marshal Dinkley, at your service.

1011
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,151
I'm sorry, did you just say "Dinkley"?

1012
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,490
What's the problem? Dinkley.

1013
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,118
I understand this big fella,
because it's myjob to observe.

1014
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:59,535
Thick neck, your head's been on a swivel
since you‘ve been on this damn plane.

1015
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:02,330
Every passenger that's got on here
you been checking out.

1016
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,542
You're a lawman.

1017
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,254
And you, Mr. Armani pants, you're a spy.

1018
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,965
-He's pretty good.
-Not bad.

1019
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,675
I get it. We're all big guys.

1020
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,464
The three of us. Alphas.

1021
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,305
Three apex predators cooped up in the sky.

1022
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,719
Tensions get high.

1023
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,888
What you throwing up on the bench?
Three, four hundred pounds?

1024
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,311
-Little less.
-Yeah, light work.

1025
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:25,148
I'm doing the same thing. Slagging weight.

1026
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,607
Clanging and banging.

1027
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:27,942
What you into?

1028
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,947
Hot yoga? Pilates?

1029
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,904
Probably mess around in the Octagon.

1030
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:35,993
Yeah, you wanna know what I do?
I sit in a can of farts all day long.

1031
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,872
That's what I'm dealing with.

1032
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,830
It's an occasional terrorist
and a lot of recycled ass.

1033
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,710
I would give anything
to be on the front line again

1034
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,584
"Again"?

1035
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:47,712
-What?
-I was a compartmented element for JSOC.

1036
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,796
You were in Delta?

1037
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,007
Sabre Squad Echo, 24/7, baby.

1038
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:54,139
"Echo"? Those guys were the warlocks
because of the magic they could do.

1039
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,549
-That's right.
-If that‘s the case,

1040
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,388
then Imma say "abracadabra," bitches.

1041
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,177
You're looking at the magic.

1042
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,598
You know what your problem is?
Your balance is off.

1043
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,061
You need a third squaddie.

1044
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,271
-No, no, we're good.
-No.

1045
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,605
I know the game.

1046
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,647
[deep voice] You hear me? I know the game.

1047
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,907
-[Hobbs] What are you doing?
-What do you mean, “What am I doing?“

1048
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,443
-Don't talk like that.
-[Shaw] You sound different.

1049
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,202
-Do I?
-That's not your voice.

1050
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:17,613
Use your regular voice.

1051
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:22,205
This is my regular voice.
I'm talking like the warlocks talk, baby.

1052
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,790
They don't talk like that.

1053
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,875
[normal voice] I'm just showing you.
That's all, guys. Look...

1054
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,416
all I'm saying is I could complete
this holy trinity that you guys have.

1055
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,754
Three would be too much.

1056
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,003
Here's my résumé. This is my card.

1057
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:36,298
'Cause if you need stuff, I'm the guy
that you call to get what you need.

1058
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,184
You want a Citation X? You want a GV?
You want a Boeing 747?

1059
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,016
You want a helicopter?
You want something stealth?

1060
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,848
I'm an air marshal. I'm your guy.

1061
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,314
-[machine whirring]
-[chain clinking]

1062
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,523
-[whirring stops]
-[loud clank]

1063
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,820
Please. Please let me go.

1064
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,367
[screams, sobbing]

1065
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,323
What do you want?

1066
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,492
I want our property
out of that girl's blood.

1067
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,207
No, the virus is too dangerous. I can't!

1068
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,591
[Brixton]
Humans must evolve, Professor.

1069
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,475
Without Eteon's upgrades,

1070
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,683
the human body's
really not worth that much.

1071
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:28,393
Maybe 11 pence worth of magnesium,
couple of pence worth of calcium,

1072
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,776
little bit of iron.

1073
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,358
Not worth much.

1074
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:36,320
I'd say, all in all,
probably about three pound.

1075
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,286
Three pound fifty, max.

1076
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:43,578
The entirety of a man's worth,
small change.

1077
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,245
You're gonna reprogram that virus for me.

1078
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,333
I won't.

1079
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,586
[screams]

1080
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,880
J‘ Shut your mouth for a minute J‘

1081
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:59,014
J‘ Eyes red, tight chest
Lips that won 't quit it J‘

1082
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,425
I I'm sick to death of this business I

1083
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:05,016
J‘ Who are you to tell me I'm ﬁnished... J‘

1084
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,021
[mufﬂed grunting]

1085
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,432
[bottle shatters]

1086
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,067
I That I’m gonna give you
The satisfaction J‘

1087
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:14,697
J‘ I left my conscience burning
In the tarmac J‘

1088
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,733
[Hobbs]
Ah, yourfriend's a Russian mobster.

1089
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,822
[Shaw]
This girl steals from Russian mobsters.

1090
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,454
Actually, she steals from everyone.

1091
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,080
It's kind of her thing.

1092
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,129
Deckard Shaw.

1093
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:37,670
Margarita.

1094
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,356
Oh, I did not see that coming.

1095
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,575
I wish I didn't see that at all.

1096
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:02,740
Me too.

1097
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,780
[Margarita] I got your list.

1098
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,828
-It's long.
-[crash, screams in distance]

1099
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,789
I asked for a house on a runway.

1100
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,830
Not sure a dozen Russians in duct tape
were on the list.

1101
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,794
Well, give me more
than three-hour notice,

1102
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:17,380
and I wouldn't have to
resort to such extremes.

1103
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:21,172
Not sure three hours has anything to do
with your extremes, Margarita.

1104
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,132
-[beeping]
-[Margarita] Qué mierda, Deckard.

1105
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,137
Eteon. Could you pick
a harder place to break into?

1106
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,899
We need to find the C-17 viral
extraction machine. Could be anywhere.

1107
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,434
That facility is
three square miles of research labs.

1108
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:37,821
Yeah. And it's a powder keg
packed with munitions.

1109
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,402
We've gotta pull a Mick Jagger.

1110
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:41,654
This sounds like a fun game.

1111
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,694
We're not getting you on the inside. No.

1112
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,830
When Deck and l were kids,
we'd spend our time coming up with grifts.

1113
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,992
A "Mick Jagger“ was a job
that required one person to showboat

1114
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:53,629
to draw all the eyes
while the others made the music.

1115
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,831
A typical inside job.

1116
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:02,008
Guys, you heard Andreiko.
They have to use the extraction machine.

1117
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,422
So they'll take me right to it.

1118
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:05,591
No, I can do it.

1119
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,055
We can do it.

1120
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,097
So now the only question is
how to ring Eteon‘s dinner bell.

1121
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,106
Oh, I can handle that part.

1122
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,313
But ﬁrst, let's get you geared up.

1123
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,193
These are your HALO parachutes.

1124
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,235
Earbuds for encrypted communication.

1125
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,280
Scorpion EVO 3 with optical sights.

1126
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,825
Ultra-thin bullet-resisting Kevlar.

1127
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,045
Infrared cameras for seeing through walls.

1128
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,088
And last but not least,

1129
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,170
compact hydrogen detonator.

1130
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,219
Put it in the right spot,
it'll blow the place sky-high.

1131
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,509
How do I look?

1132
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:47,800
Looks a little tight.

1133
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,392
How you holding up?

1134
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,737
You know, if things go south in there,
you can‘t leave me alive.

1135
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,441
We're gonna get you out of there.

1136
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,655
Let me tell you something else.

1137
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:11,032
"The key to immortality
is first living a life worth remembering.“

1138
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,081
-Is that more Nietzsche?
-Nah.

1139
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,336
That's Bruce Lee.

1140
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,667
[Hattie chuckles]

1141
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:20,082
Come on.

1142
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:29,515
[Brixton] How'd you ﬁnd her?

1143
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,269
[Margarita]
You've heard about me. I'm good at my job.

1144
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,013
[Brixton] Was she alone?

1145
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,268
Yeah.

1146
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,310
If you're lying to me,
I will cut your heart out.

1147
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,523
Do you understand?

1148
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,281
I'd be afraid if I had one.

1149
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,808
[jet engine idling]

1150
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:17,935
Now that's a ride.

1151
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,315
What a ride.

1152
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,646
I got shotgun.

1153
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:25,105
-I got shotgun.
-No, no, no. Don't start. I got shotgun.

1154
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:31,657
We're entering the drop zone!

1155
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,867
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

1156
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,123
-On my three!
-Okay.

1157
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,578
-One!
-Uh-huh.

1158
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,452
[Shaw] Ah! You asshole!

1159
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,837
Whoo!

1160
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,544
J‘ You're messing with the boss now I

1161
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,756
J‘ You're messing with the boss now I

1162
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,466
J‘ You're messing with the boss now I

1163
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,380
[Hobbs] Nobody tells me what to do.

1164
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,764
[alarm buzzes]

1165
01:02:53,645 --> 01:02:56,102
[man speaking Russian over PA]

1166
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,808
[rapid gunfire in distance]

1167
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:02,525
[indistinct chatter]

1168
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,481
[man continues speaking Russian over PA]

1169
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,616
So, I‘m intrigued,
do you wash the blood off your hands

1170
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:12,494
before you count your money
or is it afterwards?

1171
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,122
Dismissed.

1172
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,092
You don't get it, do you?
You know, the weak deal with money.

1173
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,629
We deal with evolutionary change.

1174
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:33,264
Change that sometimes require
acts of violence.

1175
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,175
Like killing innocent people with viruses?

1176
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,343
Only the weak ones.

1177
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:39,433
We're dealing with the future of
the planet. Things that money cannot buy.

1178
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,939
Oh, like your soul back?

1179
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,525
My soul?

1180
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:45,519
Your brother took my soul.

1181
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,404
The boys in the lab made me a new one.

1182
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,190
Now, that's progress.

1183
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:52,651
[man grunts]

1184
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:55,787
[helicopter passing overhead]

Welcome to the extraction room, Miss Shaw.

1186
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,176
Get her ready.

1187
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,725
It won‘t be long.

1188
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,193
[Hobbs] I tell you, we ain't gonna want
to be here when this thing goes off.

1189
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,819
[beeps]

1190
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,402
Looks like she's 400 yards through there.

1191
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,407
Looks like they're holding her
in some sort of medical pod.

1192
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,160
Timer‘s set for 45 minutes.
We get in and get out.

1193
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,164
Blow this death factory to pieces.
Remember the hallway.

1194
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,996
-No guns.
-Right. Those guys have to be alive.

1195
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:43,160
Because at the end of the hallway,

1196
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,204
the retinal scanner needs a match
to open the door.

1197
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,379
-Pick a door.
-I‘m right there.

1198
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,631
Nope, that's my door.

1199
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:49,836
What's the matter with you?

1200
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:55,342
[beeping]

1201
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,724
I made a mistake. This is your door.

1202
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,260
Oh, no. No backsies. What's the matter?

1203
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,928
You got a lot of bad guys
behind that door?

1204
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,142
Watch this. You might learn something.

1205
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,075
[all shouting]

1206
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:18,077

01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,175
[groaning]

1209
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,308
[mouthing] Watch this.

1210
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,681
[laughs]

1211
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,270

01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,125

Very good. Well done, boys.

I'm impressed that you even got in here.

That-- That's... That‘s not possible.

1240
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,974
-No. What are you doing?
-Having to extract it myself.

1241
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:35,479
Wait!

1242
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,821

There he is. Nice and rested?

1246
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,881
Get your full eight hours?
I was gonna order some room service.

1247
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,596
What do you fancy?
French toast? I'll get the order in.

1248
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,807
I just dreamt they killed you
before I woke up.

1249
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,305
Pretty disappointed right now.

1250
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:17,317
It's a little elaborate, I must admit.

1251
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,775
Old-school interrogation technique
we picked up in black ops.

1252
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,485
Shock will kill a man in three.
Do you remember that, Deck?

1253
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,238
Yeah, I remember
a lot of things from back then.

1254
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,870
I reckon you've only got
four shocks in you, boys.

1255
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,662
Yeah? I think we could take ﬁve.

1256
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:33,074
"Five"? Well, all right.

-[buzzing stops]
-[both panting]

1259
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,588
You had to open your big mouth, didn't ya?

1260
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,390
I thought it was a cool thing
to say in the moment.

1261
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,400
[grunting]

1262
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,239
Do you remember
when we were real brothers?

1263
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,950
Task Force Black.
Do you remember that, Deck?

1264
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,324
Man, we ended up
seeing the worst in people.

1265
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:19,087
Worst in our countries, our leaders,
our enemies, our friends.

1266
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,918
You don't know
the meaning of that word anymore.

1267
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,958
But don't worry about it, neither does he.

1268
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,125
He shoots them right in the head,

1269
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,918
but in your case,
I thought it was a hell of a good idea.

1270
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,553
Big man, you still talking?

1271
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,429
I said I thought it was a hell of a good--

1272
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,306
[electricity buzzing]

1273
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:35,265
[both grunting]

1274
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,102
Shit.

1275
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:42,815
[laughs] You know, it's funny
how humanity's hate for each other

1276
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,858
is stronger
than its own self-preservation,

1277
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,231
which is why we're here.

1278
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:49,863
Remember eight years ago, Deck,
when Eteon asked us tojoin their mission?

1279
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,777
Oh, you mean their death cult.

1280
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,492
-They're lunatics.
-Visionaries.

1281
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:58,251
Visionaries of a future.
A bigger future. A brighter future.

1282
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,287
You remember the data they gave us, man.

1283
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:04,628
What with environmental damage,
capitalism, terrorism,

1284
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,422
humanity wipes itself out by 2096.

1285
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,008
Now, that is scary to me.

1286
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:11,547
But if we fulﬁll Eteon's vision,

1287
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:14,343
-you save their world.
-You don't save the world with genocide.

1288
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,226
Genocide, schmenocide.

1289
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,350
You know what this virus is?

1290
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,641
This virus is a necessary
shock to the system.

1291
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,062

Whoo! That's three.

1296
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,126
[chuckles] I love this thing.

1297
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:44,835
Told you then, I'm telling you now,
your metrics are off.

1298
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,464
One good reason:
You assume the worst in people.

1299
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:51,926
People cannot be trusted to do
the right thing. Look at the two of you.

1300
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,632
The fate of the world is in your hands,
and you can't even get along.

1301
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,060
But you know all about doing
the right thing, don't you, Shaw?

1302
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,480
Little souvenir, huh, bro?

1303
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,944
You come to kill me,
I'll do the same every time.

1304
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,278
What'd you expect? A shiatsu?

1305
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,244
[laughs]

1306
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:16,658
Anyone talking to you?

1307
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:18,827
Your mama.

1308
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:22,209
-[electricity buzzing]
-[both grunting]

1309
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,505
-Yeah!
-[both grunt]

1310
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:30,506
[laughs] I get it. You‘re still mad.

1311
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:34,423
You're upset because,
hey, when you wouldn‘t turn,

1312
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,674
they asked me to come and kill you,
and, of course, I had to

1313
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,222
because you knew too much.

1314
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:42,229
But I think about that night a lot.
I think about it.

1315
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:45,267
Because what I realize now
that I did not realize then

1316
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:48,231
is that when you shot me,
you gave me a gift.

1317
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:51,280
Look at me. I'm black Superman.

1318
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,067
Bulletproof, new spine,

1319
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,908
and the more machine I become,
the more humane I am.

1320
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,951
This is what you wanna fight for.

1321
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:03,413
I'm giving you another
chance to join us, Deckard.

1322
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,703
And the boss wants big mouth as well.

1323
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,121
If not, I kill you both.

1324
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,087
Which, honestly, I'd love to do.

1325
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,637
You know Eteon.
You know what they're capable of.

1326
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,765
They rebuilt me. Dismantled him.

1327
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:22,930
Made it look he killed his own team.
Even your own sister... disowned you.

1328
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,017
[sighs]

1329
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:29,982
Just say the word, bro.
Say the word and all of this goes away.

1330
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,860
Your sister lives. His daughter lives.

1331
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:36,618
We get you some upgrades,
and we go on to saving the world.

1332
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,118
[chuckles]

1333
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,703
What's it to be?

1334
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,741
Join the evolution of man,
or die with the weak?

1335
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,293
Just get it done.

1336
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:50,878
I told the boss you wouldn't
change your mind.

1337
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,417
See you later.

1338
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,335
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!

1339
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,595
[panting]

1340
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,222
I think we should join.

1341
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,473
Join?

1342
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,054
You said some really compelling things.

1343
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,098
I mean, that black Superman thing,
that really got me. I love that.

1344
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,608
What are you, deaf, stupid, or both?
We ain't joining.

1345
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,487
There you go again, you're just thinking
about yourself. You're such a diva.

1346
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,146
What about my feelings, for once?

1347
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,533
Let me tell you something,
if we were a band, you know who you'd be?

1348
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:18,818
You‘d be Mick Jagger.

1349
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,111
"Mick Jagger"?

1350
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:22,617
Mick Jagger.

1351
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,282
[Brixton] Oi, what's it to be?

1352
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,035
In or out?

1353
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,712
-We‘re not gonna join.
-We're not gonna join.

1354
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:36,343
But since you're standing there,

It's the size of the fight in the dog.

1525
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:48,468
No, it's always the size of the dog.

1526
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:52,635
[woman]
Hey! No fighting under this roof, huh?

1527
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:57,268
Is that my Luke? Oka...

1528
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,763
My baby's home.

1529
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:02,273
Hey, Mama.

1530
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:05,777
Oka, I miss my baby boy.

1531
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:09,065
But look at you, all skin and bones.

1532
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,529
-Come over here and eat.
-No, no, no, Mama.

1533
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,193
There's no time.

1534
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:15,362
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to bring trouble here.

1535
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:18,077
You should've stayed away.
What did you bring here?

1536
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,662
-I brought the truth here.
-What truth?

1537
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:20,917
The truth is we were set up.

1538
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,169
We were framed by people
who created a deadly virus.

1539
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:26,002
-Oh, come on.
-It could go global if it's not stopped.

1540
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,791
We could all die. All of us.

1541
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,926
Everybody here in this fale,
everybody on the island.

1542
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,381
And everybody around the world.

1543
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:33,513
Jonah, I need you
to help ﬁx this machine.

1544
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:34,923
I need you to help my friends,

1545
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,467
and I need us
to build defenses around here, now!

1546
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:40,058
You think you can just come back in here
and we're gonna help you

1547
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:41,471
-after everything you did?
-Yes!

1548
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:42,935
-Not gonna happen!
-It's bigger than you and I!

1549
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,270
-I don't care!
-It's bigger than you and I! We could die.

1550
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,938
Good, because I would rather die
than help you, polo head!

1551
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:52,778
Listen, I know your brother's
hard to be around, believe me.

1552
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:54,693
But I trust him, and he brought us here

1553
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:59,160
because this place has something
that nowhere else on the planet does: you.

1554
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:01,621
You don't know me! I don't know you, okay?

1555
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,753
Time for you all to go.
Take your machine with you. Go, now!

1556
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:07,414
-Go!
-Jonah Hobbs! [speaking Samoan]

1557
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,175
You have some respect for your use.

1558
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,677
If he needs anything,
we gonna give it to him.

1559
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:16,180
The food off our tables,
the clothes off our backs,

1560
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,176
even the mana of the islands.

1561
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:25,691
And you boys, all you boys,
you show our guests here fa'aaloalo,

1562
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:30,149
or so help me God,
I'm gonna take this here slipper

1563
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:32,860
and I'm gonna sasa your big, fat heads!

1564
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,115
You boys hear me?

1565
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,361
I'm sorry to bring this here, Mama.

1566
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:39,746
Luke, this is your home.

1567
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:43,871

[director] You were right.
You don 't turn soldiers like them.

1571
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:08,942
Do what I built you to do.
You're a one-of-a-kind war machine.

1572
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,483
Bring us back my virus.

1573
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:15,364
No handcuffs this time.

1574
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,451
You can have your revenge.

1575
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,161
I will.

1576
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,574
We found 'em.
They hopped an unregistered cargo plane.

1577
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,459
-To where?
-Samoa.

1578
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:29,712
Gentlemen!
This is where you earn your upgrades.

1579
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:31,832
Bring me back my virus.

1590
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,527
[Hattie] It's quite the operation.

1591
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,992
[Hobbs] Yeah, for a chop shop.

1592
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,451
Your dad was a car thief, then?

1593
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:07,709
No. My dad actually stole everything.

1594
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,870
Drugs. Guns...

1595
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:11,788
Sounds just like my family.

1596
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,797
[Hobbs]
Mama raised us till we were teenagers,

1597
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:16,209
and my old man
started coming around again.

1598
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,469
Taking a real interest in his sons.

1599
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:20,972
The truth is,
he was just looking for a new crew.

1600
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,267
And I was the only one
to see through those lies.

1601
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:31,391
So the jobs my dad pulled
me and my brothers into

1602
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,060
just got bigger and more dangerous.

1603
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:36,563
Then eventually he knew,

1604
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:40,529
and he was okay with,
getting me and my brothers killed.

1605
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:43,945
So I turned him in.

1606
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:46,081
Or you protected your family.

1607
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:53,922
So after I put him away,
I left Samoa and I never came back.

1608
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:57,710
Well, at least one good thing came out
of me jamming that thing into my hand.

1609
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,461
Yeah, what's that?

1610
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:02,222
Got to bring you home, didn't I?

1611
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:07,889
[sighs] Lucky me.

1612
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,730
You went legit.

1613
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,941
Yeah, 100% clean now.

1614
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:19,947
Custom shop, international clients.

1615
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:22,196
See those bikes? Going to Tokyo.

1616
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:25,453
And that car? New York.
That one over there‘s going to London.

1617
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:27,034
Turns out people like our stuff.

1618
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:30,617
I needed to do something
to hold our family together.

1619
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,412
After you abandoned us.

1620
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:41,261
Hey, good news. Change of clothes. Hats.

1621
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,555
Your mum said you might like to wear this.

1622
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:47,183
Must be your favorite size. Spray on.

1623
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:51,597
Why don't you throw another jacket on?
It's 110 degrees out there.

1624
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:55,062
Hey, look, down to business.
We got any weapons?

1625
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:57,978
Oh, we got weapons.

1626
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:07,404
Mama, where's all our guns?

1627
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:08,572
I get rid of 'em.

1628
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:11,369
Very noble, Mrs. Hobbs.

1629
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:13,747
We're in serious trouble.

1630
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:15,583
That is an understatement.

1631
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:19,716
These guns, they kill all my family.

1632
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:22,043
So we gonna ﬁght.

1633
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:25,305
Gonna fight with this
and we gonna fight with this.

1634
01:33:26,059 --> 01:33:29,176
'Cause no take a real man
for pull one trigger.

1635
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:32,687
All right, we're going to war
with the family heirlooms.

1636
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,893
Got it. We're gonna need a lot more.

1637
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,899
We're never gonna survive their ﬁrepower.

1638
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:39,482
It doesn't take a man to pull a trigger,

1639
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:41,317
but for Eteon,
it does take an activation chip.

1640
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:42,731
You still got that glove?

1641
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:44,449
You‘re thinking closed-system hack.

1642
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,200
It'll level the playing ﬁeld if you can.

1643
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,577
Certainly buy us some time.

1644
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:48,782
[Hobbs] Shut their guns down.

1645
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:50,072
I'm on it.

1646
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:52,494
You ready?

1647
01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:56,544
War is what I do.

1648
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,418
Let's go old-school.

1649
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:01,924
[Hobbs] Take a look around.

1650
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:04,423
This is where we draw the line.

1651
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:07,464
Who would've thought this is where
we're gonna save the world?

1652
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,137
We need to make 'em play by our rules.

1653
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:13,019
Tomorrow morning there I] be a storm
raging on the north cliffs.

1654
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,770
We'll build a no-man’s-land there.

1655
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:18,232
And if all else fails,
that'll be our last stand.

1656
01:34:19,028 --> 01:34:21,189
How many more of these we gotta do?

1657
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,197
Just keep digging, brother.

1658
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:27,029
[Shaw]
When we were in Kandahar running raids,

1659
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:29,694
Brixton would always strike
just before dawn.

1660
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:33,080
It's when the enemy's most tired,
still under the cover of night.

1661
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:37,376
When the battle shifts into high gear,
you got the sun at your back.

1662
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:40,710
We let ‘em all in.
And we make sure they never leave.

1663
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:45,001
Kill box. I like it.
Not like we got a ton of resources.

1664
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:48,130

1690
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:44,894
J‘ I'll be bringing
All of that home with me I

1691
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:47,610
J‘ I done been around the world

1692
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:50,696
I That can do it like us
With nobody help J‘

1693
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:52,326
J‘ When the chips about to fall J‘

1694
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:53,953
J‘ And our back against the wall J‘

1695
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,239
I Know it’s only one place I call J‘

1696
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:57,623
I All roads lead home J‘

1697
01:35:57,669 --> 01:36:00,706
J‘OhJ‘

1698
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:03,747
J‘ Welcome to my city
Welcome, welcome to my city J‘

1699
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,917
J‘OhJ‘

1700
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:09,006
J‘ The only place I know J‘

1701
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:10,716
I All roads lead home J‘

1702
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,177

J‘ Welcome to my city

1704
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:19,471
J‘OhJ‘

1705
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:21,480
J‘ The only place I know J‘

1706
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:23,858
I All roads lead home J‘

1707
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:30,774
-Give me the good news, Hat.
-I‘m in.

1708
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:33,569
The only thing is, I could only block
the signal repeaters on the satellite

1709
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:34,736
for six minutes.

1710
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:39,203
Six minutes might be all the time we need.
Better than a sharp stick in the eye.

1711
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:42,119
Which is basically
all we've got to fight them with anyway.

1712
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:43,911
Done more with less, haven't we?

1713
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:45,125
[chuckles]

1714
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:02,813
[Hobbs] Hi.

1715
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:07,853
-Drink?
-Sure. Thank you.

1716
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:12,027
[bottles clink]

1717
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:15,239
Just taking it all in,
in case it's the last sunset we see.

1718
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:24,835
I shouldn't have believed
that Deckard went dark.

1719
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:34,425
Wasted so much time. I'm...

1720
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:43,354
I've spent my whole life running away.

1721
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,440
-Me too.
-Yeah?

1722
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:49,022
Yeah.

1723
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:52,856
I haven't been back here in 25 years.

1724
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:55,571
I mean, my own daughter
doesn't even know her family.

1725
01:37:57,413 --> 01:38:01,122
Well... you can change that.

1726
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:07,040
Yeah.

1727
01:38:08,174 --> 01:38:09,380
So can you.

1728
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:14,420
I got an idea. Why don‘t you and I
make a promise right here, right now?

1729
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:19,557
That when we see tomorrow's sunset,
we begin to fix the mistakes we've made.

1730
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:32,770
That's just sealed it
so you can't back out. That‘s all.

1731
01:38:36,786 --> 01:38:39,698
I don't think there's any chance in hell
I would back out.

1732
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,530
You wanna seal it again or...

1733
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,039
-[Hattie] Deﬁnitely not.
-[Hobbs] Okay.

1734
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,330
[Hattie] Maybe tomorrow, if I survive.

1735
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:50,793
-[Hobbs] Jonah.
-[Jonah] Look, don't rush me.

1736
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,424
[Hobbs]
It's almost dawn. He'll be here soon.

1737
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:55,505
-Make it happen now! Now!
-[Jonah speaking Samoan]

1738
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:57,841
Hey, don't rush me.
That's how mistakes are made.

1739
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:59,881
And how long does this process take?

1740
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:02,141
It's 30 minutes and 33 till I go viral.

1741
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:04,643
Deck, I think we need to
seriously consider option one.

1742
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:06,554
Don‘t strike a match just yet, Hats.

1743
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,393
We are seriously gonna miss this window.

1744
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,684
-Let's do this. Come on!
-Jonah, now!

1745
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:13,978
Fine, fine, okay. Here goes nothing.

1746
01:39:14,657 --> 01:39:16,568
-[beeps]
-Brace yourself, Hats.

1747
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:20,822
-It ain't gonna be pleasant.
-No, it's gonna be fine. [groans]

1748
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:25,202
[groans]

1749
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,871
[groans]

1750
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:35,712
[beeping]

1751
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:37,467
It's working. It's working.

1752
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,219
-Yeah.
-[cheering]

1753
01:39:39,265 --> 01:39:40,550
[Jonah] Yeah!

1754
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,057
[man] Hey. They triggered the alarm!

1755
01:39:47,565 --> 01:39:48,600
That's him.

1756
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:51,649
-As we planned?
-As we planned.

1757
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,396
Usos!

1758
01:39:55,865 --> 01:39:56,900
It's time.

1759
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:02,235
Jonah.

1760
01:40:07,126 --> 01:40:08,616
Just wanna say that...

1761
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,665
if this thing goes sideways and...

1762
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:14,376
and this is it...

1763
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:18,797
I'm sorry.

1764
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:23,548
I may have had my reasons,
but the fact is...

1765
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:29,095
I left you and I left our 'aiga.

1766
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:35,268
I should've come home.

1767
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:38,437
If we make it through this,

1768
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,777
you have my word
I'll never let that happen again.

1769
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:45,657
I love you, uso.

1770
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:55,333
I love you too, uso.

1771
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:05,298
[Shaw] Okay, you're mobile.

1772
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:10,640
Do you think I need to be so close
to the front line?

1773
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:12,726
Yeah, we keep you close.
Keep an eye on you

1774
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:14,603
in case we need to make a quick getaway.

1775
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:16,438
Hey, this is what we do, right?

1776
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,437
It is what we do.

1777
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:22,610
Deck...

1778
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:28,529
I overheard what Brixton said.

1779
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:33,034
That you stayed away to protect us.

1780
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:38,415
I never should've believed all that stuff,
I know it now.

1781
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:43,344
-I don't know why I did. I'm so sorry.
-Don't be.

1782
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:49,802
Don't be. Hey, look, I've done things,
done things I'm not proud of.

1783
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:54,685
Things I... have to make amends for.

1784
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:57,316
All thanks to what that bastard
put me through.

1785
01:41:58,487 --> 01:42:01,354
But right now,
the most important thing to me

1786
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:03,363
is getting my little sister home safely.

Incoming!

1865
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,146
We got a little trouble back here, Shaw.

1866
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:43,902
We'll lose 'em in no-man's-Iand.

Let's get this up!

1869
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:16,635
All right, now hit that stake.

1870
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:32,446
We're losing the rotor!

1871
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:35,529
Shit.

1872
01:52:39,503 --> 01:52:40,834
[shouts]

1873
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:41,914

[shouting]

1875
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:45,539
I got you, Hobbs.

[grunts]

1877
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:54,389
Hey!

1878
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,601
-The rotor!
-Losing power.

1879
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:06,935
-[grunts]
-Guys!

1880
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:08,604

[rapid beeping]

1889
01:54:00,709 --> 01:54:02,916
Hey, get up. Get up!

1890
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,956
Hey! Get up!

1891
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:07,666
You don't die until I tell you to die.

1892
01:54:07,716 --> 01:54:09,252
You see the extraction timer?

1893
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:13,465
When it hits zero, empty this clip
into her heart, do you understand?

1894
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:15,762
[grunting]

1895

1896
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:25,226
Hattie!

[coughing]

1898
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:30,978
[Brixton] This doesn't end your way, boys.

1899
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,022
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

1900
01:54:33,075 --> 01:54:35,908
The numbers don't add up for you.

1901
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:39,528
The evolution of man is coming,
whether you like it or not.

1902
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:44,620
[Shaw]
You know, I almost feel bad for you.

1903
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:47,077
'Cause it's not just metal
they ﬁlled your head with.

1904
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:48,711
It's bullshit.

1905
01:54:51,009 --> 01:54:53,375
l was beginning to like you two,
you know that?

1906
01:54:54,971 --> 01:54:56,336
Oh, well.

[groaning]

1911
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,212
What's the problem, boys? Does it hurt?

1912
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:38,963
Must be hard being so... human.

1913
01:55:56,283 --> 01:55:57,898

01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:08,495

-Did you see that?
-Yeah.

1916
01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:13,543
-We work together, we can hurt him.
-You're right.

1917
01:56:14,134 --> 01:56:16,750
-Time to work as a team.
-There's two of us and one of him.

1918
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:20,045
-I‘ll take a punch and let you land one.
-I‘ll do the same.

1919
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:22,381
I got your back, brother.

1920
01:56:22,434 --> 01:56:23,890
And I got yours.

1921
01:56:24,478 --> 01:56:26,093
Let's go unplug this sumbitch.

1922
01:56:30,442 --> 01:56:32,854

[groaning]

1939
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:37,061
I got it.

1940
01:58:37,694 --> 01:58:38,854
You did it, Hat.

1941
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:40,485
Never had a doubt.

1942
01:58:42,157 --> 01:58:43,738
[Hobbs]
Let's get it into safe hands.

1943
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:51,492
You set me up as a traitor.

1944
01:58:53,251 --> 01:58:55,617
Turned my own sister against me.

1945
01:58:56,588 --> 01:59:00,752
Forced me to kill my own brother. You.

1946
01:59:00,759 --> 01:59:03,045
And here we are again. Come on!

1947
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:06,754
Shaw, compared to the cause...

1948
01:59:10,185 --> 01:59:12,221
one life doesn't mean anything.

1949
01:59:12,646 --> 01:59:14,352
I don't know what
happened to you, Brixton.

1950
01:59:17,692 --> 01:59:19,273
But you made me kill you once.

1951
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:23,111
I ain't doing it again.

1952
01:59:28,453 --> 01:59:30,660
Brother, you may believe in machines...

1953
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:33,454
but we believe in people.

1954
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:35,866

[thunder rumbling]

1956
01:59:41,966 --> 01:59:44,173
You may have all the technology
in the world.

1957
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:49,554
We have heart.

1958
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:54,426
No machine will ever beat that.

1959
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:56,344
[laughs]

1960
01:59:56,398 --> 02:00:00,516
You boys, you're gonna get
one Samoan ass-whupping.

1961
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:02,274
[whooping, cheering]

1962
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:12,201
[director] Shut Brixton down.

1963
02:00:20,255 --> 02:00:21,711
So that‘s how it is?

1964
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:27,842
It's a hell of a business, boys.

1965
02:00:40,608 --> 02:00:43,395
[electrical whirring]

1966
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:48,981
[director] Brixton never really lived up
to our expectations.

1967
02:00:50,034 --> 02:00:53,902
But you three,
you outperformed your analytics.

1968
02:00:55,123 --> 02:00:57,455
You don't remember me, do you, Hobbs?

1969
02:00:59,043 --> 02:01:00,078
You will.

1970
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:02,957
It's gonna be a hell of a reunion.

1971
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:06,831
You’re on our radar now.

1972
02:01:08,219 --> 02:01:09,504
And you're on ours.

1974
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:21,312
Hey, thanks for being my sidekick
through this whole thing, brother.

1975
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:22,722
You were great.

1976
02:01:22,776 --> 02:01:24,858
Hey, how 'bout l side-kick
that stupid look off your face?

1977
02:01:24,903 --> 02:01:26,484
Yeah? How 'bout you show me right now?

1978
02:01:26,529 --> 02:01:27,814
Okay, guys.

1979
02:01:28,448 --> 02:01:29,654
Let's go home.

1980
02:01:32,619 --> 02:01:33,904
-Yeah.
-All right.

1981
02:01:33,953 --> 02:01:35,489
[Hobbs, Shaw laugh]

1982
02:01:35,538 --> 02:01:38,951
Look, Batman had Robin.
Dr. Evil had Mini-Me. You're my Mini-Me.

1983
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,457
[Shaw] Han Solo had Chewbacca.
Kermit had Miss Piggy.

1984
02:01:41,503 --> 02:01:42,834
[Hobbs] That's a low blow. Don't say that.

1985
02:01:42,879 --> 02:01:44,710
Don't argue with me on my island.
You're my sidekick.

I'm so happy you‘re back.

2003
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:51,644
[Shaw] Brought you that cake you wanted.

2004
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:54,484
I wouldn't eat it.

2005
02:02:57,704 --> 02:02:59,160
Let's get out of here.

2007
02:03:06,421 --> 02:03:08,207
How long have you been working here?

2008
02:03:10,717 --> 02:03:13,459
Sam, this is your grandma.

Good to have you home, uso.

02:03:30,111 --> 02:03:31,772

Hobbs. I hope you're sitting down,
buddy, because we got big problems.

2017
02:04:03,728 --> 02:04:06,140
God. I feel immediately better
just talking to you.

2018
02:04:06,189 --> 02:04:07,224
Is that weird?

2019
02:04:07,273 --> 02:04:10,481
Anyway, look.
The Snowﬂake virus, totally ﬁne.

2020
02:04:10,526 --> 02:04:12,482
On lockdown. In a secure asset vault.

2021
02:04:12,528 --> 02:04:17,648
But what we're dealing with
right now... is another virus.

2022
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:21,158
The last one, well, that melted
your insides, but this one...

2023
02:04:21,913 --> 02:04:24,575
melts your outsides. Literally.

2024
02:04:24,624 --> 02:04:28,242
Your skin drips off. It's like removing
a silk kimono in a hurricane.

2025
02:04:28,711 --> 02:04:33,171
It's so gross. The point is
we need to get on this, like, now.

2026
02:04:33,216 --> 02:04:35,047
I need both of you.

2027

What do you say, Becky?

2028
02:04:36,219 --> 02:04:37,629
[Sam on phone] Hey, Locke. This is Sam.

2029
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,544
-Sam?
-You must wanna talk to my dad.

2030
02:04:39,597 --> 02:04:41,133
Oh, my God. Sam.

2031
02:04:42,016 --> 02:04:46,680
Wow! You sound exactly like your dad.

2032
02:04:47,105 --> 02:04:51,018
It's freaking me out right now.
It's like listening to a mirror.

2033
02:04:51,693 --> 02:04:53,729
-Can you put Hobbs on?
-I‘m on.

2034
