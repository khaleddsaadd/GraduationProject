It's hysterical, Manny.

38
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:14,471
As long as we're laughing,
we won't cry over the box office.

39
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,140
Talk about depressing.

40
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,722
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.

41
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,350
That's depressing.

42
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:23,730
I love a good chorus line.

43
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:28,357
- What's this?
- It's a play.

44
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:29,899
Who wrote it, Annie?

45
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,779
Some guy. Driscoll.

46
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:33,488
Driscoll.

47
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,404
From the Federal Theatre.

48
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:38,855
Don't knock it, honey.
At least they got an audience.

49
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:42,443
It'll pick up. 
Isn't that right, Manny?

50
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,698
It always does.

51
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:49,704
See you tomorrow.

52
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,872
The trick is to start to build
right from the back of your throat.

53
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:57,550
Works well out through the nose, too.

54
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:59,412
Have you eaten today?

55
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:03,042
I'm not hungry. Don't worry about me.

56
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:04,323
Hey.

57
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,392
You're all I've got.

58
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,061
Come on, take me to dinner.

59
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,061
Okay.

60
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:16,268
You think the kitchen will
still be open on Third?

61
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:18,899
Soup and biscuits. Perfect.

62
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,899
Harry, what's going on?

63
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,409
- Hey, open up! We work here.
- Not anymore, lady.

64
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:36,072
It's all right for you.
We haven't had a paycheck in two weeks.

65
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,787
How we gonna eat?

66
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:40,994
- They're not getting away with this!
- They just did.

67
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:43,502
Ann, it's no use.

68
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:46,502
The show, it's over. It's done.

69
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:48,594
I'm done.

70
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,754
I'm leaving, Annie.

71
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,512
I'm going back to Chicago.

72
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,964
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,722
I'm sorry, Annie.

74
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:07,104
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

75
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:11,109
You gotta think of yourself now.

76
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:13,942
You should try out for that part.

77
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:19,024
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

78
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,987
Every time you reach out
for something you care about ...

79
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:25,779
fate comes along and snatches it away.

80
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:28,443
But not this time, Annie.

81
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:30,582
Not this time.

82
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,836
- Oh, hello, Mr. Weston.
- Oh, jeez.

83
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,955
Look, miss, I told you already,
call my office.

84
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,955
Leave your résumé with my secretary.

85
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,126
Now, why would I want to do that
when we can talk about it in person?

86
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,798
Because that's what a smart girl would do.

87
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,350
But I already sent you my résumé.
You returned it unopened.

88
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:53,471
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

89
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,183
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

90
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:56,483
Jesus, you don't give up, do you?

91
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,104
Mr. Weston, I know this role backwards.

92
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,154
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we just
gave the part to someone else.

93
00:06:01,268 --> 00:06:03,599
I'm sorry, kid. The play is cast.

94
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,357
I know times are tough.

95
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,443
You want my advice?

96
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:14,818
Use what you got. 
You're not bad-looking.

97
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,527
A girl like you doesn't have to starve.

98
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:22,250
There's a new place. 
It just opened.

99
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:30,455
Now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the Palace, you understand?

100
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:33,512
Ask for Kenny K. 
Tell him I sent you.

101
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:37,215
Just play the date, take the money ...

102
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:40,183
forget you was ever there.

103
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:12,250
How much more is there?

104
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,502
Another five reels.

105
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:16,211
Lights up.

106
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,512
This is it?

107
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:28,376
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

108
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,083
Another one of your safari pictures?

109
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:33,259
You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

110
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:35,009
Come on, fellows, you know the deal.

111
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,676
We agreed to push Maureen's start date ...

112
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:38,350
so she could get her teeth fixed.

113
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:41,232
It's not the principle of the thing,
it's the money.

114
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,848
Carl, you've been in production
for over two months.

115
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:46,640
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen ...

116
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,563
once we get them on the ship.

117
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:50,688
What ship?

118
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:53,563
The one that we hired to 
get to the location.

119
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:57,443
What location? Carl! You're supposed
to be shooting on the back lot.

120
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:59,024
Yes, I understand that.

121
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,488
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore ...

122
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:02,829
and I'll tell you why.

123
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,704
The story has changed.
The script has been re-written.

124
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,911
Life intervened.

125
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:11,376
I've come into possession of a map.

126
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:15,836
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

127
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:19,042
A place that was thought to exist
only in myth.

128
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,376
Until now.

129
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:22,471
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

130
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:23,891
Is he asking for more money?

131
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:26,563
He's asking us to fund 
a wild-goose chase.

132
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:31,061
I'm talking about a primitive world
never before seen by man.

133
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:35,232
The ruins of an entire civilisation.

134
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,404
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

135
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,942
That's where I'll shoot my picture.

136
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:47,317
Will there be boobies?

137
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:49,779
Boobies?

138
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:52,949
Jigglies. Jiblonkas. Bazooms.

139
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,864
In my experience,
people only go to these films ...

140
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:59,250
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

141
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,864
What are you, an idiot?

142
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:04,166
You think they asked De Mille if he
would waste his time on nudie shots?

143
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:07,872
No! They respected the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

144
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,376
Not that you'd know what that means,
you cheap lowlife!

145
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:18,183
Would you step out for a moment, Carl?

146
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,640
Give me that, quick.

147
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,357
You won't like it. 
It's non-alcoholic.

148
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:41,527
Preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.

149
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:47,072
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hot-headed, sure ...

150
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:50,072
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

151
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:52,455
He's had a lot of near-success.

152
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,955
He's a preening self-promoter.

153
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,323
An ambitious no-talent. The guy's 
got "loser" written all over him.

154
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,911
I understand your disappointment --
He can't direct.

155
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:03,627
- He doesn't have the smarts.
- He's washed up.

156
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,423
It's all over town.

157
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:08,512
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

158
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:10,392
The animal footage has value.

159
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:12,891
Sure. Universal are desperate
for stock footage.

160
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:15,350
Then sell it! Scrap the picture.

161
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:20,811
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

162
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,272
Get him back in.

163
00:10:25,404 --> 00:10:26,942
Mr Denham.

164
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:32,118
I want the cast and crew on the 
ship within the hour.

165
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:33,317
No, Carl, you can't do this.

166
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:35,582
Tell them the studio pressured us
into an early departure.

167
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:37,655
- It's not ethical!
- What are they gonna do, sue me?

168
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:38,829
They can get in line.

169
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,322
I'm not gonna let them kill my film.

170
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:43,829
You realise that none of
the camera equipment is on board?

171
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:46,704
We have no permits, no visas.

172
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,412
That's why I have you, Preston.

173
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,594
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

174
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:52,594
In fact, 
we have no currency of any kind.

175
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:53,754
He's there.

176
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:55,550
- Get in there.
- Who's gonna pay for the ship?

177
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:56,722
Get in.

178
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,183
- You get out of there! Come here!
- Step on it! Step on it!

179
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,299
Get out! You're finished, Denham!

180
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,521
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice at this.

181
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:16,154
I'm real good at crapping the crappers.

182
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:21,488
Red Label, 80% proof, to be
packed in a crate marked "lemonade."

183
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,655
You got it.

184
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,065
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.

185
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:27,443
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

186
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:30,118
She doesn't wanna be in this picture.

187
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,911
- Maureen pulled out.
- She pulled out?

188
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:36,072
Yesterday. I told you.

189
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,787
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

190
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:40,836
That's what you told her.

191
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:43,911
Yeah, but we're not shooting in Singapore.

192
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:48,206
God damn it, Preston, all you had to
do was look her in the eye and lie.

193
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:51,104
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

194
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:52,589
She's unavailable.

195
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:55,471
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?

196
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,848
You'll never get her
into a size four.

197
00:11:57,976 --> 00:12:01,483
You gotta get a girl that'll 
fit into Maureen's costumes.

198
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:05,065
Fay's a size four.

199
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,640
Yes, she is,
but she's doing a picture with RKO.

200
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:11,698
Cooper, huh?

201
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:15,233
I might have known.

202
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,987
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

203
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:20,534
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

204
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:22,042
- Not an option.
- Carl.

205
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,582
I said I'd find a girl.

206
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:25,911
For God's sake, Preston, 
think like a winner!

207
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:28,829
Call Jack. 
I need that goddamn screenplay!

208
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,752
Defeat is always momentary.

209
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:07,779
What?

210
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:05,371
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

211
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:07,955
Excuse me.

212
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:12,502
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

213
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,722
Vaudeville, huh?

214
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:26,848
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

215
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:28,722
If you don't kill them fast, 
they kill you.

216
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,215
Mr. Denham ...

217
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:32,268
I want you to know ...

218
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:35,154
that I'm not in the habit of 
accepting charity from strangers.

219
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:37,061
Or, for that matter ...

220
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,688
taking things that don't belong to me.

221
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:41,688
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

222
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:43,688
It's just that 
I haven't been paid in a while.

223
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:47,199
That's awful.
Anyway, Ann ... May I call you Ann?

224
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:53,655
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

225
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,211
No, no. Oh, God, no.

226
00:14:58,322 --> 00:15:00,829
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

227
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:02,994
I'm not that type of person at all.

228
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:04,752
What type of person are you?

229
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,798
I'm someone you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

230
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:11,920
Believe me, I am on the level.
No funny business. Please sit down.

231
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,550
Please. Please.

232
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:19,563
Okay.

233
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,104
Ann, I want you to imagine ...

234
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:25,891
a handsome explorer bound 
for the Far East.

235
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:28,232
You're filming in the Far East?

236
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:29,760
Singapore.

237
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:34,599
On board ship, 
he meets a mysterious girl.

238
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:38,527
She's beautiful, 
she's fragile, haunted.

239
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:42,272
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control ...

240
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:46,233
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

241
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,534
It's as if her whole life has 
been a prelude to this moment ...

242
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:56,250
this fateful meeting 
that changes everything.

243
00:15:57,376 --> 00:16:00,911
And sure enough,
against her better judgement ...

244
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,661
She falls in love.

245
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:04,423
Yes.

246
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:06,594
But she doesn't trust it.

247
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,722
She's not even sure if 
she believes in love.

248
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,423
Really?

249
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:15,976
If she loves someone, it's doomed.

250
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:17,442
Why is that?

251
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,442
Good things never last, Mr. Denham.

252
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,527
So you're interested.
Good. That's settled, then.

253
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,109
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under some time pressure.

254
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,613
- Well, I really --
- Ann, I'm telling you ...

255
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:35,024
you're perfect. Look at you.

256
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,118
You're the saddest girl I've ever met.

257
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:41,285
You're gonna make them weep, Ann.
You're gonna break their hearts.

258
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:44,627
See, that's where you're wrong, 
Mr. Denham.

259
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:47,285
I make people laugh, that's what I do.

260
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:49,955
Good luck with your picture.

261
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,323
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

262
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:56,798
I'm offering you money.

263
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,550
Adventure, fame, the thrill of
a lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

264
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:01,722
You want to read a script?

265
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:04,848
Jack Driscoll's turning in a draft
as we speak.

266
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:08,232
Jack Driscoll?

267
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,640
Sure. Why?

268
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,688
Wait. You know him?

269
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:16,317
No, not personally. 
I've seen his plays.

270
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:18,404
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann ...

271
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:21,488
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

272
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,949
He said to me, "Carl ...

273
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:26,371
"somewhere out there
is a woman born to play this role."

274
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:28,829
And as soon as I saw you, I knew.

275
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,502
Knew what?

276
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,752
It was always going to be you.

277
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:51,259
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.

278
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:52,920
Keep the change.

279
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:56,760
Is this the moving picture ship?

280
00:17:58,392 --> 00:17:59,760
Not exactly.

281
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:02,268
It's actually this one over here.

282
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:15,949
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.

283
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,864
- Is this all of the equipment?
- Yeah.

284
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:20,042
- This is all of it?
- Yeah.

285
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:21,698
- We're taking the Bell & Howell?
- Yeah.

286
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:24,502
- Good. You got all the lenses?
- Sure.

287
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:26,118
-  Carl!
- Yes!

288
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,534
Get it on board, fellows, come on.

289
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,323
It's bad, it's bad.

290
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,323
They're on their way. 
I've just had word.

291
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:37,512
- Who?
- Men in uniform.

292
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:39,676
The studio called the cops.

293
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:44,183
Englehorn! Cast off!

294
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,183
Hoist up the mainsail, 
raise the anchor ...

295
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,299
whatever the hell it is you do.
We gotta leave!

296
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:50,023
I cannot do that.

297
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:52,350
We are waiting on the manifest.

298
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:54,899
What? Who? English, please.

299
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:57,023
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

300
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,779
I'll give you 
another $1,000 to leave now.

301
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:03,233
You haven't given me the first $1,000 yet.

302
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,488
Can we talk about this later?

303
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,371
Can't you see
we're in the company of a VIP guest?

304
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,502
Ma'am.

305
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:17,752
Ann Darrow.

306
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,911
So you are ready for this voyage,
Miss Darrow?

307
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,206
Sure.

308
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:26,412
Nervous?

309
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,964
Nervous? No.

310
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,259
Why? Should I be?

311
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:37,423
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

312
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,521
Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin?

313
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:46,404
Wonderful idea. Thank you, Preston.

314
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:48,899
Miss Darrow, if you would just ...

315
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:54,272
Hi. My name is Preston. 
Carl's assistant.

316
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:57,409
$2,000. It's a deal. 
Will you take a cheque?

317
00:19:58,024 --> 00:19:59,737
Do I have a choice?

318
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,285
Please follow me.

319
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,613
If there's anything that you ...
Excuse me, fellows.

320
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:08,582
If there's anything that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

321
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,423
Oh, Jesus! Jack, you scared me.

322
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,942
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

323
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:36,589
Say I got depressed and committed suicide.

324
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,855
Say I stuck my head down the toilet.

325
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:41,855
- You want one?
- No. I can't stay, Carl.

326
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:44,942
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

327
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:48,199
- What's this?
- It's the script.

328
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,949
This is a script?

329
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:55,787
Jack, this is 15 pages.

330
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:58,502
I know, but they're good.
You've got 15 good pages there, Carl.

331
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:00,582
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

332
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:03,042
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

333
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,126
No, Jack, you can't do this to me.
I have a beginning ...

334
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,836
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.

335
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:11,126
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

336
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:18,104
All right, fine. 
We might as well settle up.

337
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:20,964
You're gonna pay me?

338
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:22,976
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

339
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,976
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

340
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:29,855
How's $2,000 sound?

341
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:32,976
Sounds great.

342
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:34,779
I thought it might.

343
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:37,357
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

344
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:52,042
And voilà.

345
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:53,911
Thanks.

346
00:21:56,704 --> 00:21:58,798
You've written "two grand."

347
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:04,627
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from the beginning.

348
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:07,392
"Two thousand dollars."

349
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,976
It is the 29th, isn't it?

350
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,811
Oh, come on, it's the 25th. 
It's the 25th.

351
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:22,442
God, I'm sorry. 
It'll just take a sec.

352
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:24,640
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me when you get back.

353
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,109
All right.

354
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:42,582
Your cabin is the last 
on the left, Mr. Baxter.

355
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:47,166
And may I just say how excited we
are to have you back with us, sir?

356
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:48,994
Be a sport and lend a hand here,
would you?

357
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:51,550
Excuse me. I'm trying to ... 
I gotta get --

358
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:55,323
Christ!

359
00:22:56,215 --> 00:22:58,042
Appreciate the help, fellow.

360
00:22:58,183 --> 00:23:00,259
Let me get the door for you.

361
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,512
Welcome to your stateroom, sir.

362
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:11,154
Dead slow ahead both, Mr. Hayes.

363
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:13,154
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.

364
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:22,488
Oh, Christ!

365
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:33,285
God damn it!

366
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:45,126
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theatre.

367
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,676
Oh, no! No!

368
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,891
You're much better off sticking with film.

369
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,563
I don't do it for the money, Carl.

370
00:23:58,023 --> 00:24:00,184
I happen to love the theatre.

371
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:02,104
No, you don't.

372
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,404
If you really loved it ...

373
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:07,404
you would have jumped.

374
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:30,661
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light, fresh straw.

375
00:24:30,787 --> 00:24:32,752
Jesus. What do you keep down here?

376
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:35,166
Lion, tiger, hippo, you name it.

377
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,911
You sell them to zoos?

378
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,594
Zoo, circus.

379
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,512
Skipper get big money for rare animal.

380
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:45,754
Careful. 
Camel have bad accident on floor.

381
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:47,589
Stain unremovable.

382
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:53,232
Skipper catch any wild animal you want.

383
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,184
He'll do you real good 
price on white rhino.

384
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,357
Choy.

385
00:24:58,688 --> 00:25:02,024
My apologies for not being able
to offer you a cabin.

386
00:25:02,154 --> 00:25:04,899
Have you found an enclosure to your taste?

387
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:07,443
Spoiled for choice.

388
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:10,233
What are you, Mr. Driscoll? A lion?

389
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:13,042
Or a chimpanzee?

390
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:16,118
I'll take this one.

391
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,754
I told you to lock it up.

392
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:34,350
- Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said --
- Lumpy doesn't give the orders!

393
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:37,471
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

394
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:42,589
Get them out of here.

395
00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:20,594
- Compliments of the chef.
- Okay.

396
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:28,009
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

397
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,891
Lamb's brains in walnut sauce.

398
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:37,730
Jimmy.

399
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,899
You run those ropes up on deck
like I told you?

400
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:41,976
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

401
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:46,199
How about
you return Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

402
00:26:54,024 --> 00:26:55,864
He don't mean no harm.

403
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:57,864
Thanks.

404
00:26:57,994 --> 00:26:59,704
- I'll keep him out of your way.
- It's okay.

405
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:02,285
It's just that he likes it down here.

406
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,955
It's where I found him four years ago.

407
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,872
Stowed away in one of them back cages.

408
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,594
His arm was broken in two places.

409
00:27:12,836 --> 00:27:15,676
He was wilder than half 
the animals in here.

410
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:19,183
Still won't tell me where he came from.

411
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:22,471
But it wasn't anyplace good.

412
00:27:25,183 --> 00:27:27,140
You got to straighten up.

413
00:27:27,442 --> 00:27:28,563
Jimmy.

414
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:32,404
You don't want to be on this ship
the rest of your life.

415
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:34,818
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't, Jimmy.

416
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:37,404
You got to be smart. 
Get yourself educated.

417
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:39,404
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

418
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:41,563
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.

419
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:43,233
I've been reading.

420
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,864
Where'd you get this?

421
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,502
I borrowed it.

422
00:27:52,787 --> 00:27:54,627
On long-term loan.

423
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,594
Look at this. Look, look.

424
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:59,911
"Adventures on a tramp steamer."
See? Just like us.

425
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:09,589
It's so nice to meet you, 
Mr. Driscoll.

426
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,183
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

427
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:20,299
Hello, Mr. Driscoll. 
It's so nice to meet you.

428
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:23,357
Actually, I'm quite familiar 
with your work.

429
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:25,640
I'm a huge fan.

430
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,640
I've read everything you've ever written.

431
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,199
No, too much.

432
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:33,151
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

433
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:35,233
Seagulls.

434
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:38,409
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

435
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:39,613
I don't care, Mike.

436
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:42,118
You're the sound recordist. 
Make it work.

437
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:46,376
Ann! Come on in.
Let me introduce you to the crew.

438
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:48,627
This is Herb, the cameraman.

439
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,911
- Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
- Likewise.

440
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:54,126
May I say what a lovely dress?

441
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:57,083
Oh, this old thing? 
I just threw it on.

442
00:28:57,627 --> 00:29:00,140
Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?

443
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,268
Now, what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast?

444
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:06,350
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

445
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:09,891
Fancy my porridge à la walnuts?

446
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:16,599
Oh, Ann, I don't believe you've met ...

447
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:20,109
Ann?

448
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:23,737
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.

449
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:32,613
Thrilled to meet you.
It's an honour to be a part of this.

450
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:35,285
Gee, thanks.

451
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:38,787
Actually, I'm quite familiar 
with your work.

452
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,412
Really?

453
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,206
Yes, and what I most admire ...

454
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:46,964
is the way you've captured
the voice of the common people.

455
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:50,009
Well, that's my job.

456
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:55,259
I'm sure you've heard this before,
Mr. Driscoll ...

457
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:56,811
if you don't mind me saying ...

458
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,942
but you don't look
at all like your photograph.

459
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,760
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute, Ann --

460
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,640
He's so much younger in person.
And much better-looking.

461
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,317
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

462
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,563
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be ...

463
00:30:13,698 --> 00:30:16,443
one of those self-obsessed literary types.

464
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:18,317
- I'm sorry, I'm not --
- You know ...

465
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:22,151
the tweedy twerp with his nose
in his book and his head up his --

466
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:29,042
It's nice to meet you, too, Miss Darrow.

467
00:30:42,964 --> 00:30:44,350
Good Christ!

468
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:14,371
She's standing at the railing.
She doesn't know it yet ...

469
00:31:15,655 --> 00:31:19,118
but they are sailing towards disaster.
You got that?

470
00:31:19,322 --> 00:31:21,042
Okay, so she turns ...

471
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:24,211
the first mate is staggering towards her.

472
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:28,166
There's a knife sticking out of his back.

473
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:31,183
Wait a sec. 
We're killing off the first mate?

474
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:33,891
That's assuming
she knows who the first mate is.

475
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:36,811
Come on, Jack. 
It was an honest mistake.

476
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,423
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened to anyone.

477
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:41,104
I was joking, Carl.

478
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,483
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

479
00:31:47,232 --> 00:31:49,317
And that's when she sees it.

480
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:52,855
Sees what?

481
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:55,233
What?

482
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,118
The island.

483
00:32:05,752 --> 00:32:10,072
We're filming on an island now?
When did this happen?

484
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:13,412
Jack, keep your voice down.

485
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:16,455
I don't want the crew getting spooked.

486
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,083
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

487
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:22,183
All right. It has a local name ...

488
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,754
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

489
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:27,550
They call it Skull Island.

490
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:29,350
Did you get that?

491
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:31,471
What's wrong with this place?

492
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:34,268
There's nothing officially wrong with it.

493
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:37,848
Because, technically,
it hasn't been discovered yet.

494
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:42,232
Okay. All right.

495
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:46,698
So we arrive at this place.

496
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:48,488
S ...

497
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:50,317
K ...

498
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:52,737
U ...

499
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:54,949
L ...

500
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:57,698
L ...

501
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:04,534
Island.

502
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:11,964
All right, everyone, from the top!
And action!

503
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,183
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

504
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:19,848
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

505
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,392
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?

506
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:25,423
No, they're a nuisance.

507
00:33:25,563 --> 00:33:29,154
- Well, I'll try not to be.
- Just being around is trouble.

508
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:38,488
Cut!

509
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,987
It's great.

510
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:45,322
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

511
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:48,322
That was very natural. I felt moved.

512
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:51,955
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

513
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,829
It was pure effluence.

514
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:55,661
I beefed up the banter.

515
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:57,872
Try to resist that impulse.

516
00:33:58,534 --> 00:34:00,166
It's just a little bit of humour, bud.

517
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,704
What are you, 
a Bolshevik or something?

518
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:04,009
Actors.

519
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:08,423
Travel the world,
but all they ever see is a mirror.

520
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:22,232
Good legs.

521
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:26,483
Sea legs. Well, you know, sea legs.

522
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:30,065
Yeah.

523
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,779
Not that you don't have good legs.
Just making conversation.

524
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,151
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

525
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,655
About the scene today with you and Bruce --

526
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,534
I know it wasn't what you wrote ...

527
00:34:42,655 --> 00:34:46,661
but Mr. Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman ...

528
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:48,955
he must ignore her.

529
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,872
And if things turn really 
hostile, then ...

530
00:34:52,798 --> 00:34:53,955
No?

531
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,754
Interesting theory.

532
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,512
I know. I should have ...

533
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:00,891
It wasn't what I had intended, but --

534
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:02,471
I'm sorry. I was ...

535
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:04,563
And you made it your own.

536
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:07,023
I was nervous.

537
00:35:07,268 --> 00:35:09,848
It was funny, actually. 
You were funny.

538
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:13,061
Please don't say another word. 
Good night.

539
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:14,563
Miss Darrow.

540
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:22,404
You don't have to be nervous.

541
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:34,250
Thank you.

542
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,798
Let's take it ...

543
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:39,166
Would you please ...
We're trying to shoot a scene.

544
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:40,872
- Okay.
- Thank you.

545
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:42,423
Okay, again.

546
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:59,154
We're close. Turn southwest.

547
00:36:59,688 --> 00:37:02,818
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

548
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:07,272
It takes us way outside the shipping lanes.

549
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:09,818
I won't sail blind in these waters.

550
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:13,118
I'll make it worth your while.

551
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,443
There's nothing out there.

552
00:37:17,211 --> 00:37:19,582
Well, then you've nothing to lose.

553
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:35,589
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore ...

554
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:38,811
what would you say?

555
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,676
I would say they're full of it, Mr. Hayes.

556
00:37:43,688 --> 00:37:46,184
Well, we turned southwest last night.

557
00:37:46,404 --> 00:37:48,023
Gentlemen, please.

558
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:51,976
- We're not looking for trouble.
- No.

559
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,688
You're looking for something else.

560
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:00,488
Yes, we are.

561
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,534
We're going to find Skull Island.

562
00:38:05,151 --> 00:38:07,949
Find it, film it, 
and show it to the world.

563
00:38:08,994 --> 00:38:12,704
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

564
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,323
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

565
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:19,259
What do you mean?

566
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:22,594
Seven years ago, me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage ...

567
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:24,215
on a Norwegian bark.

568
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:27,140
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

569
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:29,215
He'd been drifting for days.

570
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,722
His ship had run aground
on an island way west of Sumatra.

571
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:36,232
An island hidden in fog.

572
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:40,268
He spoke of a huge wall ...

573
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,317
built so long ago ...

574
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,855
no one knew who'd made it.

575
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,987
A wall 100 foot high ...

576
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:52,065
as strong today as it was ages ago.

577
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:55,864
Why'd they build the wall?

578
00:39:00,322 --> 00:39:03,955
Well, the castaway, 
he spoke of a creature ...

579
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:06,502
neither beast nor man ...

580
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:10,259
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

581
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,661
A lion or a tiger.

582
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:15,920
A man-eater.
That's how all these stories start.

583
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:17,798
What else did he say?

584
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:19,259
Nothing.

585
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:23,061
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.

586
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:26,688
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do better than that.

587
00:39:27,942 --> 00:39:30,184
Monsters belong in B movies.

588
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:32,268
If you find this place ...

589
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:36,232
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras ...

590
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,065
you won't come back.

591
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:42,563
Just as long as you understand that.

592
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:05,299
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

593
00:41:10,942 --> 00:41:13,154
You're writing a stage comedy?

594
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:15,154
I'm writing it for you.

595
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:19,184
Why would you do that?

596
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:22,987
- Why would I write a play for you?
- Yes.

597
00:41:24,698 --> 00:41:26,272
Isn't it obvious?

598
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:30,322
Not to me.

599
00:41:34,211 --> 00:41:35,371
Well ...

600
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,704
it's in the subtext.

601
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,661
I guess I must have missed it.

602
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:50,594
It's not about words.

603
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,704
Message for you, Captain.

604
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,730
What's going on?

605
00:42:56,563 --> 00:42:59,357
Hayes, why are we changing course?

606
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:03,184
- Englehorn, you can't just --
- Outside.

607
00:43:07,272 --> 00:43:09,864
There's a warrant out for your arrest.

608
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:11,829
Did you know that?

609
00:43:14,285 --> 00:43:16,864
I've been ordered to divert to Rangoon.

610
00:43:21,072 --> 00:43:24,376
Another week. 
I haven't got a film yet.

611
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:28,412
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

612
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:31,754
No, Denham. 
You risked everything I have.

613
00:43:33,722 --> 00:43:34,920
What do you want?

614
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,259
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

615
00:43:37,392 --> 00:43:39,259
I want you off my ship.

616
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:44,350
Set a course for Rangoon, Mr. Hayes.

617
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,404
I'm finished.

618
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:55,737
It's over for me, Jack.

619
00:43:57,527 --> 00:43:59,987
How'd you think this would end, Carl?

620
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:19,126
Check our position. Use the stars.

621
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:34,920
There are no stars, Captain.

622
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:38,760
What is that?

623
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,818
- What?
- That.

624
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,443
That right there.

625
00:44:49,527 --> 00:44:52,272
I don't know. 
What is it? A coffee stain?

626
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,409
Station the forward lookout
and get me the depth by lead line.

627
00:46:34,737 --> 00:46:36,199
Aye, Captain.

628
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:49,627
30 fathoms, no bottom!

629
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:54,412
Reduce speed, steerage way only.

630
00:46:55,259 --> 00:46:57,042
Dead slow ahead, both.

631
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,104
You should stop the ship.

632
00:47:03,512 --> 00:47:05,259
15 degrees port.

633
00:47:08,183 --> 00:47:09,891
We're getting out of here, Mr. Hayes.

634
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:12,061
We'll find clear conditions.

635
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,268
We have seabed!

636
00:47:20,065 --> 00:47:21,527
25 fathoms!

637
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:24,855
We're shallowing!

638
00:47:24,987 --> 00:47:26,272
20 degrees starboard!

639
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:28,409
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

640
00:47:28,527 --> 00:47:30,118
Get me another reading!

641
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:34,955
Another reading!

642
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:39,250
22 fathoms!

643
00:47:40,787 --> 00:47:42,836
- Douse the lights.
- Aye, Captain.

644
00:47:54,891 --> 00:47:56,259
10 fathoms!

645
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:10,599
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

646
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:29,371
Stop engines!

647
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:34,471
Give me some power! Half astern both.

648
00:49:34,594 --> 00:49:36,633
Half astern both, Captain!

649
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:42,392
Rocks!

650
00:49:45,563 --> 00:49:46,688
Rocks!

651
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:53,404
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

652
00:49:53,942 --> 00:49:56,272
To port! Rocks everywhere!

653
00:49:56,488 --> 00:49:58,024
Take the wheel, Hayes.

654
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,412
Hang on!

655
00:50:39,942 --> 00:50:41,232
Full ahead!

656
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:48,949
Rocks to port, Captain!

657
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:52,698
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!

658
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,688
Shore up that breach!

659
00:52:21,811 --> 00:52:25,442
Get me more men down here now!
Come on, move, move!

660
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:29,357
- Hayes!
- She's taken a pounding!

661
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,065
What about the prop?

662
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:35,317
The shaft's not bent, 
as far as we can tell.

663
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,613
But she struck hard against the rock!

664
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,864
Captain!

665
00:52:40,582 --> 00:52:42,285
Better come up quick!

666
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:45,582
Right there!

667
00:53:00,423 --> 00:53:02,471
Want me to bring them back?

668
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,811
I don't give a damn about Carl Denham.

669
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,392
I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!

670
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:10,104
Come on, move it.

671
00:53:11,299 --> 00:53:13,268
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

672
00:53:20,688 --> 00:53:22,779
Can you believe this, Jack?

673
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:27,949
We've got our picture.

674
00:54:25,582 --> 00:54:28,250
Why does Marlow keep going up the river?

675
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:31,627
Why doesn't he turn back?

676
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:36,872
There's a part of him that 
wants to, Jimmy.

677
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:41,376
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

678
00:54:43,259 --> 00:54:45,206
But there's another part ...

679
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:48,183
that needs to know.

680
00:54:51,423 --> 00:54:54,232
To defeat the thing which 
makes him afraid.

681
00:54:56,184 --> 00:54:59,442
"We could not understand
because we were too far ...

682
00:55:00,357 --> 00:55:01,521
"and could not remember ...

683
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,109
"because we were travelling
in the night of first ages ...

684
00:55:05,987 --> 00:55:08,233
"of those ages that are gone ...

685
00:55:09,488 --> 00:55:12,151
"leaving hardly a sign, 
and no memories.

686
00:55:15,072 --> 00:55:16,250
"We are accustomed to look ...

687
00:55:16,371 --> 00:55:19,502
"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster ...

688
00:55:21,994 --> 00:55:23,455
"but there ...

689
00:55:24,872 --> 00:55:28,594
"there you could look
at a thing monstrous and free. "

690
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:40,848
It's not an adventure story ...

691
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,061
is it, Mr. Hayes?

692
00:55:45,104 --> 00:55:46,392
No, Jimmy.

693
00:55:47,521 --> 00:55:48,899
It's not.

694
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,787
- It's deserted.
- Of course it's deserted.

695
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:17,285
Use your eyes, Preston. 
The place is a ruin.

696
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:21,512
Nobody's lived here 
for hundreds of years.

697
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:38,563
Mr. Denham, I think we should go back.

698
00:57:38,676 --> 00:57:40,392
I will handle this.

699
00:57:45,855 --> 00:57:47,442
Look. Chocolate.

700
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,404
You like chocolate?

701
00:57:53,233 --> 00:57:54,855
It's good to eat.

702
00:57:57,233 --> 00:57:58,488
You want?

703
00:58:04,534 --> 00:58:05,704
Take it.

704
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:15,836
Here, put it in your hand and take it.

705
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,350
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

706
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:26,722
She doesn't want the chocolate.

707
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,285
All right!

708
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:56,151
Just a bunch of women and old folks!

709
00:58:57,994 --> 00:58:59,582
They're harmless!

710
01:00:21,357 --> 01:00:22,357
Ann!

711
01:01:49,891 --> 01:01:50,920
Jack.

712
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:06,563
Seen enough?

713
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,072
Lighten the ship!

714
01:02:16,613 --> 01:02:20,250
Anything that's not bolted down
goes overboard!

715
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,072
Just heave it!

716
01:02:24,613 --> 01:02:25,829
We got away.

717
01:02:25,955 --> 01:02:27,627
We gotta be grateful for that, gentlemen.

718
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:31,455
What about Mike? He didn't get away!
He's still there!

719
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:35,471
Mike died doing what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

720
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:39,594
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm gonna finish this film for Mike!

721
01:02:46,104 --> 01:02:47,676
I'll finish it ...

722
01:02:49,633 --> 01:02:51,899
and I'll donate the proceeds ...

723
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,404
to his wife and kids.

724
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:58,404
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

725
01:02:59,272 --> 01:03:00,599
Hear, hear!

726
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,483
Chuck everything except for the potatoes!

727
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:49,855
- What's wrong now?
- Excuse me, Shakespeare.

728
01:03:50,404 --> 01:03:52,737
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

729
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:07,371
Drop those spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

730
01:04:25,848 --> 01:04:26,964
- Where's Ann?
- What?

731
01:04:27,104 --> 01:04:28,183
Where's Ann?

732
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:34,688
Ann!

733
01:04:54,409 --> 01:04:55,698
She's free!

734
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:04,627
Full ahead, both engines!

735
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,323
Ann!

736
01:05:35,443 --> 01:05:38,818
No! Stop! Turn back!

737
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:41,409
Stop!

738
01:05:43,322 --> 01:05:45,072
We have to turn back.

739
01:05:45,322 --> 01:05:46,949
They've taken Ann.

740
01:05:53,627 --> 01:05:54,787
No!

741
01:05:59,412 --> 01:06:02,471
Kong! Kong! Kong!

742
01:06:44,661 --> 01:06:48,550
All hands going ashore! 
Report to stations!

743
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:52,206
Jump to it! Jump to it, gentlemen!

744
01:06:56,009 --> 01:06:57,676
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

745
01:07:05,023 --> 01:07:06,760
Come on, move it!

746
01:07:23,818 --> 01:07:25,443
Pull harder!

747
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:28,655
Row! Row!

748
01:07:28,907 --> 01:07:30,072
Come on!

749
01:08:16,907 --> 01:08:18,042
Kong.

750
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:42,154
Spread out! Find her!

751
01:10:51,024 --> 01:10:52,371
Miss Darrow!

752
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,371
- Check up there, Jimmy!
- Everybody stay together!

753
01:10:58,829 --> 01:10:59,829
Ann!

754
01:11:01,994 --> 01:11:03,704
She's here somewhere!

755
01:11:08,455 --> 01:11:10,259
What in God's name was that?

756
01:11:16,676 --> 01:11:18,215
Behind the wall!

757
01:11:19,009 --> 01:11:20,563
Behind the wall!

758
01:12:12,268 --> 01:12:13,589
She's gone!

759
01:12:24,599 --> 01:12:26,317
Carl, what is it?

760
01:12:32,987 --> 01:12:34,613
You saw something.

761
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:44,627
You can take Hayes and 15 others.

762
01:12:45,322 --> 01:12:48,083
I'll put a guard on the gate 
until you return.

763
01:12:48,211 --> 01:12:50,627
The rest of you stay with the ship.

764
01:12:50,798 --> 01:12:51,836
Choy!

765
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:55,183
Not you, Jimmy.

766
01:12:55,323 --> 01:12:57,423
Come on, Mr. Hayes. Look at them.

767
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:59,259
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

768
01:12:59,392 --> 01:13:00,633
Stay here.

769
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,633
- Miss Darrow needs me!
- No!

770
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:10,855
Bring the tripod 
and all of the film stock.

771
01:13:10,976 --> 01:13:13,357
You wanna go with the 6-inch lens?

772
01:13:13,855 --> 01:13:16,232
The wide-angle will do just fine.

773
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:25,151
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

774
01:13:25,698 --> 01:13:27,443
And you got 24 hours!

775
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:29,322
24 hours?

776
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:31,752
This time tomorrow, we haul anchor.

777
01:13:55,215 --> 01:13:56,730
Miss Darrow!

778
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,232
Ann!

779
01:14:03,688 --> 01:14:05,023
Miss Darrow!

780
01:14:13,987 --> 01:14:14,779
Miss Darrow!

781
01:14:32,752 --> 01:14:34,376
What is it?

782
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,423
Fire!

783
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:48,521
Cut it out.

784
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,232
Hold your fire.

785
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:53,404
Hold your fire!

786
01:15:23,704 --> 01:15:26,594
Stay down, damn it. Stay down.

787
01:15:41,232 --> 01:15:44,848
Come on. Come on. Come on.

788
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:18,512
Good shooting, Mr. Hayes.

789
01:16:22,676 --> 01:16:24,964
Aren't these things
supposed to be extinct?

790
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,633
They are now.

791
01:16:32,392 --> 01:16:34,976
What the hell kind of a place is this?

792
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:51,907
Miss Darrow!

793
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:57,704
Ann!

794
01:18:13,268 --> 01:18:14,392
No!

795
01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:34,118
Ann!
Miss Darrow!

796
01:18:42,787 --> 01:18:43,787
Ann!

797
01:18:53,215 --> 01:18:54,206
Ann!

798
01:19:31,285 --> 01:19:33,661
Christ, it's a bleeding bone-yard!

799
01:19:35,072 --> 01:19:37,502
They've been ripped limb from limb.

800
01:19:39,376 --> 01:19:41,798
Ann! Ann!

801
01:19:55,061 --> 01:19:57,299
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

802
01:19:57,423 --> 01:19:59,350
- Jesus, Jimmy.
- Hey, I need that!

803
01:19:59,483 --> 01:20:00,688
I'm not giving you a gun!

804
01:20:00,811 --> 01:20:02,760
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

805
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:06,404
I was in the Army. I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

806
01:20:07,899 --> 01:20:10,024
I wanna help bring her back.

807
01:20:17,907 --> 01:20:19,829
Don't make me regret it.

808
01:20:47,512 --> 01:20:49,512
Conserve your ammunition!

809
01:20:58,848 --> 01:21:00,350
I'm knackered.

810
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,730
I gotta have a breather.
Great idea.

811
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,272
Fellows, we don't have time for this.

812
01:21:06,357 --> 01:21:08,779
We've lost too much ground already.
Come on, get up!

813
01:21:08,855 --> 01:21:12,272
They're not about to quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

814
01:21:12,443 --> 01:21:14,779
All right, you got five minutes!

815
01:21:14,987 --> 01:21:16,949
Everybody stay in sight.

816
01:21:20,949 --> 01:21:24,371
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

817
01:21:54,599 --> 01:21:55,976
Bloody Nora!

818
01:22:03,109 --> 01:22:05,317
Is that what took Miss Darrow?

819
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:13,042
There's only one creature capable
of leaving a footprint that size.

820
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:21,376
The abominable snowman.

821
01:22:22,994 --> 01:22:25,661
- Yeah, a snowman.
- We dead meat.

822
01:22:26,376 --> 01:22:28,798
It's got to be what, 20, 25 feet?

823
01:22:30,891 --> 01:22:32,323
Carl saw it.

824
01:22:33,722 --> 01:22:35,215
Let's ask him.

825
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:38,563
Denham!

826
01:22:41,104 --> 01:22:42,392
Where'd he go?

827
01:23:02,582 --> 01:23:04,371
Walk forward, Bruce.

828
01:23:04,907 --> 01:23:06,704
- What?
- You're the star of this picture.

829
01:23:06,787 --> 01:23:09,829
Get into character
and head toward the animals.

830
01:23:15,955 --> 01:23:18,594
What the hell kind of a place is this?

831
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,104
Are you sure about this, Denham?

832
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:33,688
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

833
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,688
I need you in the shot,
or people will say they're fake.

834
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,942
Nobody's gonna think these are fake.

835
01:23:47,599 --> 01:23:49,613
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

836
01:23:49,698 --> 01:23:50,987
I'm not moving.

837
01:23:56,787 --> 01:23:59,118
Mother of God.

838
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:22,423
What's this?

839
01:24:48,655 --> 01:24:50,118
What is it? What is it? 
Where's Carl?

840
01:24:50,211 --> 01:24:52,994
Carl? He's up there, filming.

841
01:25:03,423 --> 01:25:04,836
Bugger this!

842
01:25:05,594 --> 01:25:06,920
Watch out.

843
01:25:12,215 --> 01:25:13,563
Run, Jack!

844
01:25:16,848 --> 01:25:19,350
- Holy Christ.
- Go, Jimmy, run!

845
01:25:20,268 --> 01:25:21,760
Run, run, run!

846
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,233
- Let go!
- I'm not leaving the camera!

847
01:25:30,317 --> 01:25:31,599
Let go, you idiot!

848
01:25:31,698 --> 01:25:33,527
Carl, run!

849
01:25:46,955 --> 01:25:48,211
Look out!

850
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:50,083
Look out!

851
01:26:40,376 --> 01:26:41,911
Coming through!

852
01:27:46,183 --> 01:27:47,215
No!

853
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,183
Come on.

854
01:28:30,323 --> 01:28:33,042
Carl! Carl!

855
01:28:36,215 --> 01:28:38,760
Get up! Come on. Come on.

856
01:28:53,563 --> 01:28:56,233
Mr. Denham! Mr. Denham!

857
01:28:56,949 --> 01:28:59,563
Herb! Herb, come on!

858
01:28:59,655 --> 01:29:01,371
Take the tripod!

859
01:29:01,582 --> 01:29:02,829
Come on!

860
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:06,582
I'm pulling you up! 
Hold on to your end!

861
01:29:06,655 --> 01:29:07,704
Go!

862
01:29:07,787 --> 01:29:09,455
No, 
I'm not going anywhere without you!

863
01:29:10,118 --> 01:29:12,787
- You gotta leave me!
- Shut up and hold on!

864
01:30:20,521 --> 01:30:22,268
Jimmy, do a head count.

865
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,848
I want to know how many are injured
and how bad.

866
01:30:24,942 --> 01:30:26,184
Injured?

867
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:29,357
Four of us are dead!

868
01:30:36,065 --> 01:30:37,818
It's not your fault.

869
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:40,987
What happened to Herb is no one's fault.

870
01:30:41,443 --> 01:30:43,829
You're absolutely right, Preston.

871
01:30:44,233 --> 01:30:46,655
And I'll tell you something else.

872
01:30:46,737 --> 01:30:48,994
Herbert didn't die for nothing.

873
01:30:49,409 --> 01:30:52,211
He died for what he believed in,
and I'm gonna honour that.

874
01:30:52,285 --> 01:30:56,323
He died believing there was still
some mystery left in this world.

875
01:30:56,836 --> 01:30:59,412
And we could all have a piece of it ...

876
01:30:59,627 --> 01:31:02,166
for the price of an admission ticket.

877
01:31:02,376 --> 01:31:06,083
God damn it, Preston, we're gonna
finish this film for Herb.

878
01:31:06,512 --> 01:31:08,183
We'll finish it ...

879
01:31:08,259 --> 01:31:11,183
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

880
01:31:18,521 --> 01:31:20,688
Come on, guys. We need more rope.

881
01:31:22,599 --> 01:31:24,599
All right, we gotta get back to the ship.

882
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:28,357
- Englehorn sails in nine hours.
- So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

883
01:31:28,443 --> 01:31:31,065
Hey, do you hear me?
We're gonna be stranded here.

884
01:31:32,907 --> 01:31:36,322
Miss Darrow was a great gal, no question.

885
01:31:36,787 --> 01:31:38,534
And she was a wonderful person.

886
01:31:38,613 --> 01:31:41,829
It's a terrible loss
and we're all gonna miss her.

887
01:31:42,118 --> 01:31:46,042
I always knew you were nothing like
the tough guy you play on screen.

888
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,836
I just never figured you for a coward.

889
01:31:47,911 --> 01:31:50,042
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

890
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:53,042
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

891
01:31:53,126 --> 01:31:56,676
In the real world, they got bad teeth,
a bald spot, and a beer gut.

892
01:31:56,754 --> 01:32:00,259
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

893
01:32:01,722 --> 01:32:03,215
Be seeing you.

894
01:32:04,423 --> 01:32:05,811
Anyone else?

895
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:09,299
- Well, see you.
- Come on.

896
01:37:05,964 --> 01:37:07,183
No!

897
01:37:07,836 --> 01:37:09,206
I said no!

898
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:20,521
That's all there is. 
There isn't any more.

899
01:39:42,722 --> 01:39:45,512
Get them off the boat.
Get them off the boat.

900
01:39:47,891 --> 01:39:49,268
Keep paddling.

901
01:40:27,215 --> 01:40:29,140
What the hell was that?

902
01:41:10,166 --> 01:41:12,550
Come on. Get them out of there!

903
01:41:14,323 --> 01:41:15,676
Preston!

904
01:41:20,811 --> 01:41:22,471
Give me your hand.

905
01:41:23,061 --> 01:41:24,268
Jack!

906
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:31,023
Jack!

907
01:41:35,818 --> 01:41:37,109
- Choy!
- Help!

908
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,233
Swim, you filthy bugger.

909
01:42:48,211 --> 01:42:49,704
Choy!

910
01:42:51,512 --> 01:42:52,627
Stay with him.

911
01:42:52,704 --> 01:42:54,126
Swim to shore as fast as you can!

912
01:42:54,215 --> 01:42:55,206
Hold on. Preston!

913
01:42:55,964 --> 01:42:58,323
Whatever happens,
don't let go of the camera!

914
01:42:58,423 --> 01:43:00,009
Don't let go of the camera!

915
01:43:07,811 --> 01:43:09,589
Come on, get up out of that water.

916
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,404
Get up!

917
01:43:52,183 --> 01:43:53,676
Come on, come on.

918
01:44:06,023 --> 01:44:07,976
Preston. Preston.

919
01:44:19,655 --> 01:44:20,864
It's working.

920
01:44:39,215 --> 01:44:41,215
Did you get that, did you?

921
01:45:41,563 --> 01:45:42,891
No!

922
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:44,899
No.

923
01:45:49,184 --> 01:45:50,268
No.

924
01:46:40,688 --> 01:46:42,024
What is it?

925
01:46:46,563 --> 01:46:47,899
Mr. Hayes?

926
01:46:51,443 --> 01:46:54,024
If anything happens, 
I want you to run.

927
01:46:54,534 --> 01:46:56,042
You understand?

928
01:46:56,322 --> 01:46:59,534
I'm not a coward. I ain't gonna run.

929
01:47:00,864 --> 01:47:03,322
It's not about being brave, Jimmy.

930
01:47:31,563 --> 01:47:32,730
Go back!

931
01:47:34,442 --> 01:47:36,109
Back across the log!

932
01:47:36,184 --> 01:47:38,899
- I ain't gonna run!
- Get Jimmy out of here!

933
01:47:38,987 --> 01:47:40,655
- No!
- Get back! Get back!

934
01:47:45,072 --> 01:47:46,409
Move back!

935
01:47:59,376 --> 01:48:01,754
- No! No!
- Stay back.

936
01:48:04,259 --> 01:48:05,323
No!

937
01:48:10,676 --> 01:48:12,104
Look at me.

938
01:48:14,268 --> 01:48:16,848
- Let him go!
- You got to run, Jimmy.

939
01:48:21,061 --> 01:48:22,563
Do as I say.

940
01:48:23,599 --> 01:48:25,109
Go with Jack.

941
01:48:27,599 --> 01:48:29,024
Run!

942
01:48:32,199 --> 01:48:34,613
- No!
- Shoot him!

943
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:54,872
Here! Over here!

944
01:49:13,109 --> 01:49:15,065
Hold on! Hold on!

945
01:49:19,154 --> 01:49:21,779
Lumpy! Help me!

946
01:49:23,655 --> 01:49:25,065
Bloody hell, Choy!

947
01:54:46,661 --> 01:54:47,752
No!

948
01:54:51,911 --> 01:54:53,126
Oh, my!

949
02:01:28,488 --> 02:01:29,829
Wait!

950
02:02:19,272 --> 02:02:20,527
Carl.

951
02:02:25,502 --> 02:02:27,211
Jimmy. Jimmy.

952
02:02:29,911 --> 02:02:31,376
You all right?

953
02:03:21,166 --> 02:03:22,582
No.

954
02:04:14,661 --> 02:04:16,704
Get off! Get it off!

955
02:04:24,259 --> 02:04:25,392
Get off!

956
02:04:39,232 --> 02:04:40,599
Get it off!

957
02:04:41,184 --> 02:04:42,730
Get it off! Get it off!

958
02:05:46,151 --> 02:05:47,443
Kill it!

959
02:05:59,376 --> 02:06:00,798
Stop moving!

960
02:06:20,848 --> 02:06:22,563
Get it off my face!

961
02:06:23,521 --> 02:06:25,942
- Stay still.
- I am standing still.

962
02:06:28,442 --> 02:06:30,233
- Hold on.
- Be careful!

963
02:07:05,061 --> 02:07:07,722
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!

964
02:07:08,392 --> 02:07:09,891
Coming through!

965
02:07:18,357 --> 02:07:20,942
Get out of there now! Climb!

966
02:07:28,409 --> 02:07:30,233
Nobody get in my way.

967
02:07:33,199 --> 02:07:34,955
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

968
02:07:35,042 --> 02:07:37,911
Get up the rope. Let's go. Hurry up.

969
02:08:04,232 --> 02:08:06,299
Jimmy, let's go.

970
02:08:10,942 --> 02:08:12,527
- Come on.
- Okay.

971
02:08:15,737 --> 02:08:16,855
Go.

972
02:08:21,698 --> 02:08:23,582
Just as you go down ...

973
02:08:24,613 --> 02:08:26,907
for the third and final time ...

974
02:08:27,955 --> 02:08:30,872
as your head disappears
beneath the waves ...

975
02:08:31,455 --> 02:08:33,872
and your lungs fill with water ...

976
02:08:34,126 --> 02:08:38,412
do you know what happens in those
last precious seconds before you drown?

977
02:08:38,661 --> 02:08:41,550
Come on, buddy. Get up the rope.
Come on. Get out of here. Come on.

978
02:08:41,627 --> 02:08:44,206
Your whole life passes before your eyes.

979
02:08:44,392 --> 02:08:46,848
And if you've lived as a true American ...

980
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:48,964
you get to watch it all in colour.

981
02:08:50,183 --> 02:08:51,811
Oh, and you will.

982
02:08:51,891 --> 02:08:54,563
Now, why don't you climb up the rope, huh?
Come on.

983
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:01,855
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

984
02:11:56,502 --> 02:11:58,042
It's beautiful.

985
02:12:19,483 --> 02:12:20,811
Beautiful.

986
02:12:32,317 --> 02:12:33,655
Beautiful.

987
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:22,233
There.

988
02:13:25,317 --> 02:13:28,409
- Thank God.
- Don't thank God. Thank Mr. Baxter.

989
02:13:28,527 --> 02:13:30,864
He insisted on a rescue mission.

990
02:13:31,864 --> 02:13:35,322
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

991
02:13:36,613 --> 02:13:38,864
That's the thing about cockroaches.

992
02:13:38,955 --> 02:13:42,376
No matter how many times
you flush them down the toilet ...

993
02:13:42,455 --> 02:13:44,955
they always crawl back up the bowl.

994
02:13:45,872 --> 02:13:48,722
Hey, buddy? I'm out of the bowl.

995
02:13:49,512 --> 02:13:52,754
I'm drying off my wings
and trekking across the lid.

996
02:14:00,104 --> 02:14:01,350
Driscoll!

997
02:14:02,811 --> 02:14:06,483
Don't be a fool! Give it up. 
It's useless!

998
02:14:07,730 --> 02:14:09,109
She's dead.

999
02:14:11,899 --> 02:14:13,488
She's not dead.

1000
02:14:17,409 --> 02:14:19,613
Jack's gonna bring her back ...

1001
02:14:20,582 --> 02:14:23,199
and the ape will be hard on his heels.

1002
02:14:23,907 --> 02:14:26,613
We can still come out of this thing okay.

1003
02:14:29,042 --> 02:14:30,582
More than okay.

1004
02:14:31,829 --> 02:14:33,412
Think about it.

1005
02:14:33,502 --> 02:14:37,166
You got a boat full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

1006
02:14:37,259 --> 02:14:39,126
You wanna trap the ape?

1007
02:14:45,964 --> 02:14:47,589
I don't think so.

1008
02:14:48,183 --> 02:14:51,589
Isn't that what you do? 
Live animal capture?

1009
02:14:53,104 --> 02:14:55,140
I heard you were the best.

1010
02:15:02,976 --> 02:15:04,109
Jack!

1011
02:15:07,199 --> 02:15:08,949
Look after yourself!

1012
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:11,527
Keep the gate open, will you?

1013
02:15:11,613 --> 02:15:13,272
Sure thing, buddy.

1014
02:15:14,042 --> 02:15:15,371
Good luck!

1015
02:15:28,627 --> 02:15:30,009
I'm sorry.

1016
02:18:08,836 --> 02:18:09,920
Ann.

1017
02:19:18,442 --> 02:19:19,527
Jack!

1018
02:19:20,404 --> 02:19:21,527
Run!

1019
02:19:51,798 --> 02:19:53,423
Jack, Jack!

1020
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:02,299
Jack.

1021
02:20:11,357 --> 02:20:13,317
Ann, it's okay.

1022
02:20:14,233 --> 02:20:16,599
Ann, let's go. Let's go. Come on!

1023
02:20:29,829 --> 02:20:31,455
Let's go. Come on.

1024
02:20:31,911 --> 02:20:33,166
Come on!

1025
02:22:05,409 --> 02:22:06,488
Carl!

1026
02:22:06,655 --> 02:22:09,582
Please! Somebody help us!

1027
02:22:11,502 --> 02:22:12,994
They've gone.

1028
02:22:14,534 --> 02:22:16,627
Carl. Christ.

1029
02:22:17,166 --> 02:22:18,285
Carl!

1030
02:22:19,126 --> 02:22:21,206
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!

1031
02:22:21,376 --> 02:22:22,594
Not yet.

1032
02:22:24,009 --> 02:22:25,126
Wait.

1033
02:22:25,798 --> 02:22:26,891
Wait.

1034
02:22:31,009 --> 02:22:32,140
Wait!

1035
02:22:42,855 --> 02:22:44,065
Come on!

1036
02:23:56,534 --> 02:23:58,042
- Now!
- Throw them!

1037
02:23:58,126 --> 02:23:59,502
Throw!

1038
02:24:00,376 --> 02:24:01,412
No!

1039
02:24:03,754 --> 02:24:05,009
Hold him!

1040
02:24:05,083 --> 02:24:07,083
Are you out of your mind?

1041
02:24:15,259 --> 02:24:17,423
- Stop!
- Hold the line!

1042
02:24:18,140 --> 02:24:19,563
Keep him down!

1043
02:24:25,268 --> 02:24:26,760
Heave!

1044
02:24:27,154 --> 02:24:28,483
Please!

1045
02:24:28,942 --> 02:24:30,640
No! Stop!

1046
02:24:30,987 --> 02:24:32,065
Jack.

1047
02:24:33,698 --> 02:24:35,024
- No.
- Get her out of ...

1048
02:24:35,109 --> 02:24:36,779
- They'll kill him!
- There's nothing we can do.

1049
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:38,317
- No!
- Get her out of his sight!

1050
02:24:38,409 --> 02:24:40,322
- It's too late.
- Throw it!

1051
02:24:42,613 --> 02:24:43,698
Look out!

1052
02:24:45,994 --> 02:24:47,502
Let go of me.

1053
02:24:51,627 --> 02:24:53,250
We gotta go. Come on.

1054
02:24:53,836 --> 02:24:54,994
- Come on.
- Stop it.

1055
02:24:55,083 --> 02:24:56,627
Leave me alone!

1056
02:24:57,798 --> 02:24:59,323
Ann, please come on.

1057
02:25:06,633 --> 02:25:08,471
- Kill it!
- No. No!

1058
02:25:08,676 --> 02:25:10,920
It's over, you goddamn lunatic!

1059
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:14,688
All of you, run!

1060
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:16,404
Come on. Come on!

1061
02:25:33,371 --> 02:25:34,949
Look out!

1062
02:25:45,704 --> 02:25:47,376
Move it! Move it!

1063
02:25:49,722 --> 02:25:51,083
Come on, come on!

1064
02:26:00,023 --> 02:26:01,633
- Stay there!
- It's me he wants!

1065
02:26:01,730 --> 02:26:03,891
- Please stop this!
- Move! Hold onto her!

1066
02:26:03,976 --> 02:26:06,640
- Ann, go.
- Please, I can stop this!

1067
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:08,232
- No!
- Ann, stay there!

1068
02:26:10,730 --> 02:26:12,109
Get it out!

1069
02:26:14,855 --> 02:26:16,737
Get the hell out of here!

1070
02:26:16,818 --> 02:26:18,779
- Come on!
- Jimmy, don't be crazy! Come on.

1071
02:26:18,855 --> 02:26:20,151
Don't be crazy.

1072
02:26:21,371 --> 02:26:22,443
Let me go!

1073
02:26:23,787 --> 02:26:25,233
Cast off!

1074
02:26:27,582 --> 02:26:28,829
Come on, Carl!

1075
02:26:30,285 --> 02:26:32,126
- Row!
-  Wait.

1076
02:26:32,412 --> 02:26:34,534
Row, God damn it!

1077
02:26:44,754 --> 02:26:45,920
Go back.

1078
02:26:52,848 --> 02:26:53,920
Jimmy, no!

1079
02:27:00,942 --> 02:27:01,976
No!

1080
02:27:19,118 --> 02:27:21,412
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1081
02:27:21,502 --> 02:27:22,994
Hide out in back!

1082
02:27:44,976 --> 02:27:46,633
- Wait!
- No!

1083
02:27:47,299 --> 02:27:49,942
No! No! Please don't!

1084
02:29:48,118 --> 02:29:50,655
The whole world will pay to see this.

1085
02:29:53,409 --> 02:29:55,409
We're millionaires, boys!

1086
02:29:55,704 --> 02:29:57,911
I'll share it with all of you!

1087
02:29:58,412 --> 02:30:02,911
In a few months, his name
will be up in lights on Broadway!

1088
02:30:05,083 --> 02:30:09,215
Kong! The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1089
02:31:10,104 --> 02:31:11,392
Mr. Denham!

1090
02:31:12,483 --> 02:31:14,521
What can I say? What can I say?

1091
02:31:14,589 --> 02:31:15,976
Any comments, Mr. Denham?

1092
02:31:17,299 --> 02:31:18,976
The Mayor, thank you.

1093
02:31:20,154 --> 02:31:21,232
Ready.

1094
02:31:21,317 --> 02:31:22,640
What am l?

1095
02:31:23,065 --> 02:31:24,818
Thank you very much.

1096
02:31:28,655 --> 02:31:30,151
Get used to it.

1097
02:31:30,371 --> 02:31:33,534
- Listen, it's great to see you. Ready?
- I'm really appreciating that ...

1098
02:31:33,613 --> 02:31:35,072
- Look at you!
- I remember you.

1099
02:31:35,151 --> 02:31:38,151
- You're a lucky guy, Denham.
- Am I a lucky guy?

1100
02:31:38,250 --> 02:31:40,042
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1101
02:31:53,836 --> 02:31:55,009
Carl!

1102
02:31:56,891 --> 02:31:58,061
- Zelman!
- I told them.

1103
02:31:58,140 --> 02:31:59,563
I know you did and I appreciate it.

1104
02:31:59,633 --> 02:32:01,589
Let's get a shot of this.

1105
02:32:02,140 --> 02:32:03,268
Come on.

1106
02:32:04,023 --> 02:32:06,640
- Big smile.
- Yeah! That's great!

1107
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:11,640
Look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.

1108
02:32:12,404 --> 02:32:14,899
- No woman is worth this.
- This woman is worth it.

1109
02:32:14,987 --> 02:32:16,987
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

1110
02:32:17,065 --> 02:32:18,272
Oh, really?

1111
02:32:18,357 --> 02:32:20,024
She's not gonna buy this for a second.

1112
02:32:20,118 --> 02:32:22,272
Shut up and hand me the grapefruit!

1113
02:32:24,409 --> 02:32:27,072
You're writing a comedy?
Yes, I am.

1114
02:32:27,829 --> 02:32:29,752
I'm writing it for you.

1115
02:32:31,704 --> 02:32:33,582
Why would you do that?

1116
02:32:34,594 --> 02:32:36,955
Why would I write a play for you?

1117
02:32:40,376 --> 02:32:42,009
Isn't it obvious?

1118
02:32:42,259 --> 02:32:43,754
Oh, I'm sorry.

1119
02:32:45,009 --> 02:32:47,215
I couldn't help but overhear.

1120
02:32:50,392 --> 02:32:53,104
So, he took me to
this fancy French restaurant ...

1121
02:32:53,183 --> 02:32:55,976
and halfway through the
hors d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand.

1122
02:32:56,061 --> 02:32:58,268
And that's when he told you how he felt?

1123
02:32:58,350 --> 02:33:01,061
- No. He never said it.
- He never said it?

1124
02:33:01,154 --> 02:33:03,109
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

1125
02:33:03,184 --> 02:33:05,184
Well, then how does she know that it's real?

1126
02:33:05,272 --> 02:33:08,737
- He said it was not about the words.
- Oh, please!

1127
02:33:08,949 --> 02:33:13,065
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

1128
02:33:13,443 --> 02:33:17,737
He said we'd talk about it later.
Only there was no later.

1129
02:33:19,443 --> 02:33:21,118
It never happened.

1130
02:33:22,042 --> 02:33:23,787
That's how it ended.

1131
02:33:23,955 --> 02:33:27,661
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

1132
02:33:29,550 --> 02:33:32,911
I honestly believed
things might actually work out ...

1133
02:33:34,009 --> 02:33:36,009
which was really very ...

1134
02:33:39,206 --> 02:33:40,512
foolish.

1135
02:33:40,754 --> 02:33:43,392
Men. Oh, they'll give you the world ...

1136
02:33:43,471 --> 02:33:45,848
but they let the one thing
that truly matters ...

1137
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:47,811
slip through their fingers.

1138
02:33:47,891 --> 02:33:49,154
Typical.

1139
02:33:49,730 --> 02:33:53,404
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use their brains.

1140
02:33:54,357 --> 02:33:56,272
Romance. Who needs it?

1141
02:34:20,994 --> 02:34:22,323
Thank you.

1142
02:34:23,166 --> 02:34:24,550
Thank you.

1143
02:34:27,471 --> 02:34:28,798
Thank you.

1144
02:34:30,633 --> 02:34:31,964
Thank you.

1145
02:34:33,811 --> 02:34:35,676
Ladies and gentlemen ...

1146
02:34:36,848 --> 02:34:39,688
I'm here to tell you 
a very strange story.

1147
02:34:40,140 --> 02:34:42,357
The story of our adventure ...

1148
02:34:42,688 --> 02:34:45,899
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths ...

1149
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:48,357
their lives lost ...

1150
02:34:48,899 --> 02:34:51,199
in pursuit of a savage beast ...

1151
02:34:52,154 --> 02:34:54,779
a monstrous aberration of nature.

1152
02:34:55,987 --> 02:34:58,698
But even the meanest brute can be tamed.

1153
02:34:58,864 --> 02:35:01,582
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, 
as you will see ...

1154
02:35:01,655 --> 02:35:03,655
the beast was no match ...

1155
02:35:03,907 --> 02:35:05,911
for the charms of a girl.

1156
02:35:08,955 --> 02:35:10,836
A girl from New York ...

1157
02:35:13,754 --> 02:35:15,550
who melted his heart ...

1158
02:35:16,259 --> 02:35:19,126
bringing to mind that 
old Arabian proverb ...

1159
02:35:20,798 --> 02:35:24,183
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty ...

1160
02:35:25,009 --> 02:35:27,140
"and beauty stayed his hand.

1161
02:35:28,183 --> 02:35:32,061
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

1162
02:35:39,855 --> 02:35:43,317
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you ...

1163
02:35:43,443 --> 02:35:46,443
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.

1164
02:35:47,563 --> 02:35:52,233
He was a king in the world he knew,
but he comes to you now a captive.

1165
02:35:53,443 --> 02:35:55,118
Ladies and gentlemen ...

1166
02:35:55,211 --> 02:35:59,752
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1167
02:36:09,083 --> 02:36:12,215
Don't be alarmed. It's perfectly safe.

1168
02:36:12,550 --> 02:36:15,964
These chains are made of chrome steel!

1169
02:36:36,737 --> 02:36:38,527
Observe, if you will ...

1170
02:36:41,787 --> 02:36:43,737
I am touching the beast.

1171
02:36:44,072 --> 02:36:48,285
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

1172
02:36:55,412 --> 02:36:57,083
Crank them up, fellas.

1173
02:37:16,404 --> 02:37:18,599
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight ...

1174
02:37:18,688 --> 02:37:20,268
a surprise guest.

1175
02:37:21,109 --> 02:37:23,488
The real-life hero of this story.

1176
02:37:23,688 --> 02:37:26,404
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!

1177
02:37:27,779 --> 02:37:32,582
The man who risked all to win
the freedom of a helpless female.

1178
02:37:33,737 --> 02:37:36,072
A big hand for Mr. Bruce Baxter!

1179
02:37:41,955 --> 02:37:43,787
Thank you. Thank you.

1180
02:37:44,787 --> 02:37:46,126
Thank you.

1181
02:38:13,527 --> 02:38:14,987
He was right.

1182
02:38:16,527 --> 02:38:20,065
About there still being some mystery
left in this world ...

1183
02:38:20,488 --> 02:38:23,024
and we can all have a piece of it ...

1184
02:38:23,151 --> 02:38:25,737
for the price of an admission ticket.

1185
02:38:26,994 --> 02:38:30,042
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

1186
02:38:31,412 --> 02:38:34,829
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things he loves.

1187
02:38:49,259 --> 02:38:51,848
Please remain calm, 
ladies and gentlemen ...

1188
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:55,232
for we now come
to the climax of this savage ritual.

1189
02:38:55,423 --> 02:38:58,154
The sacrifice of a beautiful young girl.

1190
02:38:58,688 --> 02:39:02,357
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!

1191
02:39:03,563 --> 02:39:07,640
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl I've ever met!

1192
02:39:08,357 --> 02:39:09,987
Miss Ann Darrow.

1193
02:39:57,599 --> 02:39:59,357
Save me from the beast!

1194
02:40:08,233 --> 02:40:09,443
Help me!

1195
02:40:13,582 --> 02:40:15,072
Where is she?

1196
02:40:16,072 --> 02:40:17,627
- Where's Ann?
- I have no idea.

1197
02:40:17,704 --> 02:40:21,083
I heard he offered her all kinds of
money and she turned him down flat.

"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."

1210
02:41:26,471 --> 02:41:28,350
We have to get these people out of here.

1211
02:41:28,423 --> 02:41:30,942
Everyone needs to leave, okay? 
Come on.

1212
02:41:32,140 --> 02:41:34,730
Let him roar. It makes a swell picture.

1213
02:41:36,184 --> 02:41:37,232
Head for the exits.

1214
02:41:37,317 --> 02:41:40,109
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

1215
02:41:47,907 --> 02:41:49,371
Excuse me, fellows.

1216
02:41:50,072 --> 02:41:52,787
Coming through. Coming through, fellows.

1217
02:41:56,322 --> 02:41:59,322
Get me down! Help me, please!

1218
02:42:01,752 --> 02:42:04,661
Somebody! Somebody help me!

1219
02:42:08,042 --> 02:42:10,722
Go! Go! Get out!

1220
02:42:14,676 --> 02:42:16,183
Go! Go!

1221
02:43:51,166 --> 02:43:53,627
There they are. 
Come on, come with me.

1222
02:44:06,392 --> 02:44:08,061
Go!
Wait for me!

1223
02:44:08,976 --> 02:44:10,357
Go back!

1224
02:44:17,357 --> 02:44:18,599
This way!

1225
02:44:26,409 --> 02:44:27,582
Help!

1226
02:44:35,955 --> 02:44:37,126
No!

1227
02:45:16,864 --> 02:45:19,534
Taxi! Follow that ape.

1228
02:45:19,613 --> 02:45:21,118
Come on, pal, we gotta draw him off.

1229
02:45:21,211 --> 02:45:22,994
It's all yours, buddy.

1230
02:45:39,423 --> 02:45:41,104
Better get out of here, lady!

1231
02:46:01,855 --> 02:46:03,109
Come on.

1232
02:46:12,285 --> 02:46:13,409
Buddy!

1233
02:46:14,613 --> 02:46:16,829
Come on. Come on.

1234
02:46:35,633 --> 02:46:36,891
Look out.

1235
02:46:59,698 --> 02:47:00,949
Jesus Christ.

1236
02:52:24,166 --> 02:52:25,083
Fire!

1237
02:52:27,512 --> 02:52:28,594
Stop!

1238
02:52:44,154 --> 02:52:45,599
Listen up.

1239
02:52:45,688 --> 02:52:48,640
This is New York City,
and this is sacred ground.

1240
02:52:48,730 --> 02:52:50,184
You hear me?

1241
02:52:50,818 --> 02:52:53,443
It was built for humans, by humans.

1242
02:52:53,527 --> 02:52:55,855
Not for stinking lice-infested apes.

1243
02:52:56,109 --> 02:52:57,864
The thought of some mutant gorilla ...

1244
02:52:57,949 --> 02:53:02,655
crapping all over the streets of 
this fair city, fills me with disgust.

1245
02:53:02,752 --> 02:53:04,752
So this is how it's gonna be.

1246
02:53:04,829 --> 02:53:07,166
We find it. We kill it.

1247
02:53:07,250 --> 02:53:10,502
We cut its ugly head off and we ram it up ...

1248
02:53:30,521 --> 02:53:32,392
No. No.

1249
02:56:03,589 --> 02:56:04,920
Beautiful.

1250
02:56:11,357 --> 02:56:12,442
Yes.

1251
02:56:15,065 --> 02:56:16,442
Yes, it is.

1252
03:01:09,891 --> 03:01:11,140
Look at that.

1253
03:01:12,976 --> 03:01:14,104
Hey! Hey!

1254
03:01:14,350 --> 03:01:16,299
Nobody past this point.

1255
03:01:17,232 --> 03:01:19,154
You can't go in there!

1256
03:01:23,317 --> 03:01:24,599
Stop him!

1257
03:01:27,698 --> 03:01:29,987
Hey! Get back. 
You're not allowed up there!

1258
03:01:30,065 --> 03:01:31,698
- What's going on?
- Go!

1259
03:05:13,534 --> 03:05:14,836
No!

1260
03:05:16,009 --> 03:05:19,042
No!

1261
03:05:25,140 --> 03:05:27,754
Please! No!

1262
03:05:28,140 --> 03:05:29,268
No!

1263
03:08:25,907 --> 03:08:28,199
Ann. Ann.

1264
03:09:17,527 --> 03:09:18,829
Move along.

1265
03:09:19,285 --> 03:09:21,199
Just one shot! One shot!

1266
03:09:21,864 --> 03:09:23,955
- Come, come!
- Boys, how about a photo?

1267
03:09:24,042 --> 03:09:25,072
Look at me.

1268
03:09:25,151 --> 03:09:26,911
Come on, watch the camera.

1269
03:09:29,704 --> 03:09:31,250
Come a little closer.

1270
03:09:31,911 --> 03:09:34,083
That's it, folks. 
Show's over. Step back!

1271
03:09:34,166 --> 03:09:36,376
Clear the area. That's it. 
Shove off, boys.

1272
03:09:37,083 --> 03:09:38,627
Why'd he do that?

1273
03:09:38,920 --> 03:09:41,423
Climb up there and get himself cornered.

1274
03:09:41,512 --> 03:09:43,811
The ape must have known what was coming.

1275
03:09:43,891 --> 03:09:46,563
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.

1276
03:09:52,760 --> 03:09:55,483
What does it matter? Airplanes got him.

1277
03:09:58,065 --> 03:10:00,024
It wasn't the airplanes.

1278
03:10:04,409 --> 03:10:06,698
It was beauty killed the beast.
