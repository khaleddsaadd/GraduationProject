17
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,944
During the Civil Wars,

18
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:20,783
an endless cycle of conflict
left the countryside overrun by bandits.

19
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,079
Peaceable folk lived in terror
of the thunder of approaching hooves...

20
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,209
Take this village too?

21
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,087
Take it! Take it!

22
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,423
Not so fast!

23
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,593
We just took their rice last fall.

24
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,679
They'll have nothing now.

25
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,639
Very well.

26
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,642
We'll return
when that barley's ripe!

27
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,969
Is there no god to protect us?

28
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,351
Land tax, forced labor,
war, drought...

29
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,730
and now bandits!

30
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,821
The gods want us farmers dead!

31
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,741
That's right!
We're better off dead!

32
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,663
What's all this?
Crying won't change anything.

33
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,000
The magistrate can do more
than collect taxes.

34
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,002
We can ask him for help.

35
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,005
We know all about him!

36
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,509
He shows up after they're gone,
acting big while he surveys the damage.

37
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,844
That's right. He's useless.

38
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:51,308
We might as well hand over
our rice and barley to the bandits

39
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,769
and just hang ourselves!

40
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,689
That'll bring the magistrate
here in a hurry!

41
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,993
We'll kill those bandits.

42
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,038
We'll kill them all.

43
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,249
Never again!
Let's kill 'em all!

44
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,543
Not me!

45
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,380
I couldn't possibly -

46
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,467
That's crazy talk.

47
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,722
So we can kill defeated samurai
but not bandits?

48
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,685
Stop it! This is no time
to fight amongst ourselves.

49
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,858
We don't have a chance against bandits.
And when we lose?

50
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,404
They'll slaughter us all,
down to the last unborn child.

51
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,032
I've had enough!
Better to risk it all

52
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,910
than to live like this.
Kill or be killed!

53
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,537
Rikichi!

54
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,748
The farmer's only choice
is to endure.

55
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,042
We can't defy the powerful.

56
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,589
When the bandits arrive,
we'll greet them meekly

57
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,592
and quietly hand over
all our barley.

58
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,638
We'll plead with them to leave
just enough for us to survive.

59
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:17,269
"That's all we ask,"
we'll beg on our hands and knees.

60
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,148
What bandit will agree to that?

61
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:26,695
Have you forgotten how low we had
to stoop for the rice we're eating now?

62
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,218
We should go see the Old Man.

63
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,804
Let him decide what to do.

64
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,580
<i>Consider who</i>
<i>we're dealing with here.</i>

65
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,211
<i>Give a wolf a taste of your leg</i>
<i>and he'll ask for your hand.</i>

66
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,214
<i>Once they have a taste,</i>
<i>they'll be back in the fall.</i>

67
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,676
<i>- But what if we lose?</i>
<i>- Then we're no worse off!</i>

68
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,221
<i>Without our barley,</i>
<i>we're doomed anyway!</i>

69
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,602
We fight.

70
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,565
Old Man, that's madness.

71
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,192
We're farmers.
What do we know of battle?

72
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,903
We'll hire samurai.

73
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,408
Whoever heard of farmers
hiring samurai?

74
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,746
I saw it with my own eyes,

75
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:47,002
when the village you were born in
was torched.

76
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:52,215
I saw it when we escaped
to this village here.

77
00:09:53,426 --> 00:10:00,307
The only village that didn't burn
was the one that hired samurai.

78
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,311
But Old Man, there are
different kinds of villages and villagers.

79
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,022
How are we to feed samurai
when we live on rice gruel?

80
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,440
We'll make do on millet!

81
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,944
Show me a samurai who'll fight
for farmers in return for food!

82
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,113
They're a proud lot.

83
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,364
Look.

84
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,286
Find hungry samurai.

85
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,293
Even bears come down from
the mountains when they're hungry.

86
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,548
How dare you?

87
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,469
You're nothing but a farmer!
I'm still a samurai!

88
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,471
I don't need your charity!

89
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,184
Fool!

90
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,110
What'd I tell you?

91
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,145
Look, the barley's ripe.

92
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,315
Ten days already
since we left the village.

93
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,901
What do we do?

94
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,448
This barley's early,
not like our mountain barley.

95
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,871
Hey, we're soaked through
to the bone.

96
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,750
Find any cheap, strong
and foolhardy samurai?

97
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,749
Leftovers.

98
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,376
You can have 'em cheap.

99
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,835
That's a laugh!

100
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,464
- What's so funny?
- He's blind.

101
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,343
- What about you, then?
- Not me.

102
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,887
I'd rather eat horseshit.

103
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:34,437
- Won't get a nose bleed outta him.
- Cleaned him out gambling last night.

104
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,483
Pulled his sword when he lost,
so the three of us beat him up.

105
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,069
Not a drop left in his nose now.

106
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,410
Don't bother.
They only eat millet.

107
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,663
Is that true?
You can't live like that.

108
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,791
Without nourishment
you'll go night-blind.

109
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,876
I've got just four left.

110
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,713
I'll trade 'em all
for a cup of rice.

111
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,881
What do you say?

112
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,262
Damn! What a bunch.

113
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,533
What a waste.

114
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,705
If we still had that rice,
we coulda bought 40 of those.

115
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,789
Shut up!

116
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,834
But it's true, right?

117
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,921
The blockhead's cracking up!

118
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,883
What a show.
Go at it, boys.

119
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:54,434
Who ever heard
of anything so unfair?

120
00:14:55,978 --> 00:15:01,858
We give him his fill of rice
and a free bottle of sake,

121
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,029
and he thanks us
with a beating.

122
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,574
Good for him!

123
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,744
Not like this one
playing possum here.

124
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:18,249
Say, let's go home.
Let's just go home.

125
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,795
Look at him sobbing.

126
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,671
Misses his wifey.

127
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,925
I'd pay good money
to watch the two of 'em going at it.

128
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:31,721
Let's hurry
and get back to the village.

129
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,391
Go on home. You can't afford buns,
let alone samurai.

130
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,438
Farmers like us know
good from bad when it comes to seed,

131
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,441
but not when it comes
to samurai.

132
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,447
Besides, we're no match
for the tough ones,

133
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:56,121
and the only ones interested
are weaklings.

134
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:08,967
If I lost last night,
it was only because I was starving.

135
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,930
Liar! You had plenty
of money to gamble.

136
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,307
Jerk!

137
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,017
Wanna fight?

138
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,187
It's a fight.

139
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,985
Over here!
Wake up!

140
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,165
Quit that strumming, monk!
It's depressing!

141
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,169
Keep it up, grandpa.
We're on your side.

142
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,826
Rikichi!

143
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,245
Stop it, Manzo!

144
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,707
You said we were going home,
you son of a bitch!

145
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,586
I said we'd go home,
not bargain with bandits!

146
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,923
If we can't hire samurai,
what's left?

147
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,759
It's bargain or nothing!

148
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,346
Fine, have it your way!

149
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,522
But tell me:

150
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,776
If we do strike a bargain,

151
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,237
what have we got
to offer this year?

152
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,240
Are you willing to give 'em
your daughter?

153
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,118
Shino's a fine-lookin' girl.

154
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,837
What's going on?

155
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,967
There's a thief in that barn.
We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide.

156
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,492
How many thieves are there?

157
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,743
Just one.

158
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,620
One?

159
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,874
All of you can't take
a single thief?

160
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:14,921
We don't dare make a move.
He took a kid in there with him.

161
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,882
Says he'll kill him
if we attack.

162
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,636
Listen. Hear him?

163
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,102
Poor thing.

164
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,437
It all happened
in the middle of the night.

165
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,900
Poor kid's been bawling
the better part of a day.

166
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,237
He can barely
make a sound now.

167
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,577
He's only seven.
Imagine how his parents feel.

168
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,498
Who's that samurai
getting his head shaved?

169
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:55,044
No idea. We asked him for help
and he agreed right away.

170
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,255
Then he asked us
for two rice balls.

171
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:01,634
He asked a monk to shave his head
and lend him his robes.

172
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,386
No idea what he's up to.

173
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:40,149
<i>Stay back!</i>
<i>Any closer and I kill the brat!</i>

174
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,276
I'm a monk.

175
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,612
<i>Stay back!</i>

176
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,034
I'm just a monk.
I mean you no harm.

177
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,791
I won't come in.

178
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:01,087
I just thought the child
must be very hungry.

179
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,719
I've brought some rice balls.

180
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,722
You should eat one yourself.

181
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,770
Won't you have one?

182
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,105
What's wrong?

183
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,027
<i>Throw 'em here!</i>

184
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,862
Here.

185
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,809
My baby!

186
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,008
Even you can't object
to a samurai like that.

187
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,011
Ask him quickly.
It'll be harder in town.

188
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,113
What do you want?

189
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,834
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto.
Please make me your disciple!

190
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,879
Disciple?

191
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,883
As you see, I'm a ronin.
The name is Kambei Shimada.

192
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,761
I don't take on disciples.

193
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,639
Get up.
I can't talk to you like this.

194
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,059
I'm begging you -
let me be your disciple.

195
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:07,106
First get off your knees.
We'll talk as we go.

196
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,162
I'm at a loss.

197
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,415
You think far too highly of me.

198
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,332
No, sir -

199
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,251
Just hear me out.

200
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,588
There's nothing special
about me.

201
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:34,049
I may have seen
my share of battle,

202
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,219
but always on the losing side.

203
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,181
That about sums me up.

204
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,434
Better not to follow
such an unlucky man.

205
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:48,606
No, I'm determined to follow you
whether you allow me to or not.

206
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,399
I forbid it.

207
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:54,445
I don't have the means
to travel with an attendant.

208
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,417
Can I help you?

209
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,344
What do you want?

210
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,561
Insolence!

211
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,524
Stay out of this, little chick.

212
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,654
Are you a samurai?

213
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,493
Damn right I am!

214
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,248
I wonder.

215
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,465
Bastard.

216
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,358
Who was that?

217
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,283
Leave him be.

218
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,469
I beg of you, sir!

219
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,516
You idiot.
Why don't you scram?

220
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,647
Stubborn old fool.
They'll eat it and run like last time.

221
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,113
It will never work.

222
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,783
Sir, we could arm the villagers
with bamboo spears.

223
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,578
- I thought of that.
- But, sir -

224
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,667
This isn't a game.

225
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,757
They may be bandits,
but they ride 40 strong.

226
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,594
Two or three samurai
won't suffice.

227
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,444
Defense is more difficult
than offense.

228
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,698
You say there are mountains
behind the village?

229
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,699
Yes.

230
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,618
Passable by horse?

231
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,786
Yes.

232
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,255
Fields in front.

233
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,967
Until those are flooded
with water,

234
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,345
you're open to mounted attack
on four sides.

235
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,516
You need at least four men,
one to guard each side.

236
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,645
Two more to guard the rear.

237
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,983
No matter how frugal
our estimate,

238
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,194
we need seven,
including me.

239
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,699
We can manage
seven somehow.

240
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,618
But the Old Man said four.

241
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,495
It's only three more.

242
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,539
Hold on a second.

243
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,459
I haven't accepted your offer.
I'm only speculating.

244
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:43,340
First of all, it's not easy
to find trustworthy samurai.

245
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:48,721
What's more,
all you have to offer is food.

246
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,517
Only those out to fight
for the hell of it will agree.

247
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:58,230
Besides, I'm sick of fighting.

248
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,358
Age, I suppose.

249
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,799
Good thing
I wasn't born a peasant.

250
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,055
Better to be born a dog.
Goddamn it.

251
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,309
Go ahead - hang yourself and die!
You're better off dead!

252
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,894
Silence, you lout!

253
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,688
What's it to you?
I'm only telling the truth.

254
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:44,151
What truth? What the hell do you know
of these farmers' suffering?

255
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,944
Don't make me laugh!

256
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,821
Like you would know.

257
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,864
How dare you?

258
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,451
You heard right. If you know,
why don't you help them?

259
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,583
So you wanna fight?

260
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,378
That's enough.

261
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,553
Enough!

262
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,147
Hey, samurai, look at this.

263
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,191
This here's your dinner.

264
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,027
But what do you think
these blockheads eat?

265
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,487
Millet.

266
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:32,783
They eat millet
to feed you white rice.

267
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,453
This is the best they can offer.
What do you say to that?

268
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,165
- All right, then.
- What?

269
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,792
Quit your jabbering.

270
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,883
I won't let this rice go to waste.

271
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,944
Manzo and the others are back!

272
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,127
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

273
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,005
They stayed behind.
We still need more samurai.

274
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,506
The samurai are coming?

275
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,717
They sure are.
Seven of 'em.

276
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,135
Seven?

277
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,682
Seven.

278
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:43,478
I was against it
because you said four, Old Man.

279
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:50,360
I figured we'd need
at least ten.

280
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:55,616
But if I'd said ten,
we'd have ended up with 15.

281
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,203
That's the way it goes.

282
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,707
Old Man, I'm worried.

283
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,007
The village girls will go crazy
over the samurai.

284
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:16,386
If the samurai touch 'em,
all hell will break loose.

285
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,893
Bandits are coming, you fool.

286
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,521
Your head is on the block,

287
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,150
and all you think of
are your whiskers?

288
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,953
Samurai, sir.

289
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,425
- You require my services?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,636
Who's to be my opponent?

291
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,555
<i>Katsushiro.</i>

292
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,403
Hide just inside the door.

293
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,324
Strike that ronin as he enters.

294
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,831
Here he comes.

295
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,672
Don't hold back.
Give him a real whack.

296
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,286
Excellent!

297
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:09,333
Please don't take offense.
I am Kambei Shimada.

298
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,962
We're seeking expert swordsmen
and have no time to waste.

299
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,464
Forgive me.

300
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,382
What's this about?

301
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,385
The reason better be good,
or I'll have to redeem my honor.

302
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:25,057
I humbly beg your pardon.
We only sought to test your skill.

303
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,560
We must soon contend
with a gang of bandits.

304
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,397
I see.
And whose clan do you serve?

305
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:37,986
It pains me to tell you,
but we're fighting for farmers.

306
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,696
- Farmers?
- That's right.

307
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,325
This job affords
no stipend and no reward.

308
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,579
But we can eat our fill
as long as we fight.

309
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,247
This is absurd!

310
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,376
My ambitions
are greater than that.

311
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:58,340
That's a shame.
Won't you reconsider?

312
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,592
I will not.

313
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:11,978
Sir, we lost a good man there.
Such a fine swordsman.

314
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,734
What's wrong?

315
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:04,322
That one samurai's good,
but how'll the other six be?

316
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,616
Enough of your worrying.

317
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:11,413
How can we know before they get here?
Don't worry till you've seen 'em.

318
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,638
<i>That one there.</i>

319
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,326
Excuse me, samurai, sir.

320
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,371
Just like last time?

321
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,794
Sure.
It's good practice for you.

322
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,870
Surely you jest.

323
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,498
No offense intended.

324
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,265
I'm with you.

325
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,936
But I have to say

326
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,231
that although I understand
the farmers' suffering

327
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:06,069
and understand
why you would take up their cause,

328
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:11,157
it's your character
that I find most compelling.

329
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:16,705
In life one finds friends
in the strangest places.

330
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,297
- What is your name?
- Gorobei Katayama.

331
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,465
A name fit for a giant, no?

332
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,938
Yohei, what are you doing?
Hurry and wash the rice.

333
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,944
Yohei!

334
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:52,991
What's wrong?

335
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,787
Someone stole the rice.

336
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,093
You idiot!
Didn't I warn you?

337
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,055
I was so careful.

338
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:24,272
I slept the whole night
hugging that rice jar.

339
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,363
Fine, then!
I'll get more from home!

340
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,157
But what'll we do

341
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,576
till you get back?

342
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:41,039
There's only a handful left.

343
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,385
Stop that, you idiot!

344
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,346
Hide that money.
The master's returning.

345
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,563
I ran into you
at just the right time.

346
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,488
So you're still alive.
I figured you'd long since left this earth.

347
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,831
Now tell me,
what happened after that?

348
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,585
I hid among the grasses
in the moat until dark.

349
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:16,885
When the outer walls tumbled down
on me in flames, I knew I was finished.

350
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,346
What ran through your mind
at that moment?

351
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,225
Nothing special.

352
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,355
Sick of fighting yet?

353
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:44,454
Truth is, there's a tough battle ahead
leading to neither money nor rank.

354
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,998
Will you join us?
- Yes.

355
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,043
This may be the one
that kills us.

356
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,941
Where are they
when you need 'em?

357
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,235
What do you need, sir?

358
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,654
Samurai.

359
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,827
There's a pretty poor excuse for one
in my backyard.

360
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,664
I couldn't believe his gumption.

361
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,583
He says,
"I'm hungry. Feed me.

362
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,838
I'm broke, though,
so I'll pay you by chopping wood."

363
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,596
I like his frankness.

364
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,222
Never seen a man
split wood before?

365
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,892
Sure, but you do it
with such relish.

366
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:33,021
It's just my nature.
Sorry if it bothers you.

367
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,110
You're very good.

368
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,655
It's nothing compared
to how I cut down men.

369
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:46,367
- Have you cut down many?
- That I have.

370
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,245
There's no cutting me off
when I start cutting.

371
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,919
So I make it a point
to run away first.

372
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,505
A most excellent approach.

373
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,883
Why, thank you kindly.

374
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:13,937
Tell me, do you feel like
cutting down 30 bandits?

375
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,540
Let us commence!

376
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,758
Too bad.

377
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,217
It's a draw.

378
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,927
I'm afraid not.

379
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,387
I won.

380
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,142
That's ridiculous!

381
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,646
If these were steel,
you'd be dead now.

382
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,904
- Then we fight with steel!
- Don't throw your life away.

383
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:28,821
What?

384
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,325
Don't you see?
With steel blades, you'd die.

385
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,951
It's a waste of your life.

386
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,579
Wait! Don't try to flee.

387
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,169
Draw! This isn't
a contest of words!

388
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,292
This is preposterous.

389
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,629
There's no contest.

390
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,163
How did you fare?

391
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,170
We let a good fish get away.
An excellent swordsman.

392
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,673
They say the fish that gets away
looks bigger than it really is.

393
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,091
No.

394
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,679
I watched him cut a man down
with my own eyes.

395
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,354
It was amazing.

396
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:29,775
A man obsessed only
with testing the limits of his skill.

397
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,403
I doubt he'll join us.

398
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,989
- That's a shame.
- Indeed.

399
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,160
I did tell him
where we're staying, though.

400
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,412
And how did you fare?

401
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,789
- Caught one.
- I see.

402
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,418
- As a swordsman, barely mediocre.
- Barely mediocre?

403
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,839
But an honest, amusing man.

404
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,800
Something about him
brightens one's spirits.

405
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,720
He'll be a treasure in hard times.

406
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,430
Much obliged.

407
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:06,395
Actually, I did land one myself.
- The one dressed as a peddler?

408
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,730
That's right.

409
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,566
In fact, he's an old trusted friend.

410
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,366
I'll bring some water.

411
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,163
I'm Heihachi Hayashida.

412
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,333
A modest warrior
of the Wood-Chop School.

413
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,175
Just three more to go.

414
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,761
Three? Don't you mean two?

415
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,347
No, we can't afford
to take a child along.

416
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:43,808
Master!

417
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,977
I know, I know.

418
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,771
I know what you'll say.

419
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:53,150
I was once your age, you know.

420
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,279
Hone your skills,

421
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,782
then go to war
and do great things.

422
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,995
Then become lord
of your own castle and domain.

423
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:10,251
But as you dream those dreams,
before you know it,

424
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,628
your hair will turn
as gray as mine.

425
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,301
By that time

426
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,971
you've lost your parents
and you're all alone.

427
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,188
Tomorrow you go home.

428
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,066
You've learned a lot
these four or five days.

429
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,193
You have
fine stories to tell.

430
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,796
Please, sir.
I beg you to let him come along.

431
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,965
Why not let him come?
You call him a kid, but -

432
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,509
Actually,

433
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,928
kids work harder than adults.

434
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,557
But only if you treat them
like adults.

435
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:52,561
Then let's treat him
like an adult.

436
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,736
That means only two more.

437
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,115
Actually just one, it seems.

438
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,748
You wish to join us?

439
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,876
I'm very grateful.

440
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,087
- When do we depart?
- Tomorrow.

441
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:22,925
Tomorrow?

442
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,639
This is enough. We don't have time
to find the last one.

443
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,102
All right, then.

444
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,023
Master!

445
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,651
Master!
- All right.

446
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,947
- Master!
- All right! That's enough of that!

447
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,580
Hey, I just found
a real tough samurai.

448
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,124
There was a huge fight.
They were no match for him.

449
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,918
Never seen anything like it.
He's like a wild dog.

450
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:01,130
Someone stopped the fight.
They started drinking.

451
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,965
I told him about you.

452
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,884
He's on his way.

453
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,263
Shall we give him the usual?

454
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,987
What are you doing?

455
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,114
Testing him.

456
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,159
That's a dirty trick!

457
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,786
Hey, samurai!
- Just shut up and watch.

458
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,997
A true samurai won't get hit.

459
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,874
But this guy's drunk!

460
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,919
A samurai never drinks
enough to dull his wits.

461
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,353
I told you!
You guys are nuts.

462
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,272
What the -

463
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,987
Who the hell hit me?

464
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,338
You?

465
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,680
Who hit me?

466
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,979
You?

467
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,733
Damn bastard!

468
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,097
You again!

469
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,145
I see that bald head of yours
in my dreams!

470
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,649
Hey, you.

471
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:29,445
How dare you even ask me
if I'm a samurai!

472
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,989
You got some nerve!

473
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,701
Don't mess with me.

474
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:46,003
I may look like hell,
but I'm a real samurai!

475
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:53,969
I've been looking for you
ever since that day.

476
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,264
Wanted you to see this.

477
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,316
Look at this!

478
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:12,488
This is my family tree.
All my ancestors are here.

479
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:18,661
Damn you, trying to make
a fool outta me. Screw you.

480
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,872
Looky here.

481
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,292
Making a fool outta me.

482
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,218
My honorable self
is right here.

483
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,638
So this Kikuchiyo here
would be you?

484
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,640
That is correct.

485
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:44,186
"Kikuchiyo,
born February 17, 1574."

486
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,357
What's so damned funny?

487
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,611
You hardly look
13 years old to me.

488
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,491
If you are in fact
the Kikuchiyo listed here,

489
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,536
you'd now be precisely
13 years old.

490
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,793
Where'd you steal
this family tree?

491
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,755
Steal it? Shit!

492
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,383
Damn jerks.

493
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,593
To hell with samurai.

494
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,222
To hell with samurai!

495
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,477
Hey, you bastard!

496
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,606
Come back here!

497
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,068
Goddamn it,
you son of a bitch!

498
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,540
What's wrong, teenager?
Here you are.

499
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,919
Damn you!

500
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,506
Come back here!

501
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,502
What's wrong, Lord Kikuchiyo?

502
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,425
What's the matter, junior?

503
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,604
Screw samurai!

504
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,833
- Is he really a samurai?
- In his own mind, anyway.

505
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,887
<i>Take me too!</i>

506
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,228
Hey, Kikuchiyo.

507
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,774
Guard your treasure.

508
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,612
Let me go too!

509
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,363
What is it, Father?

510
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,757
What is it?

511
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,760
What are you staring at?

512
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:56,521
Shino, cut off your hair.

513
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,316
Cut your hair
and dress like a man.

514
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,987
- What are you talking about?
- Just cut it off!

515
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:08,951
It's only because I love you.
No telling what those samurai'll do!

516
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,035
No!

517
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,621
No, I won't!

518
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,460
Shino!

519
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,653
He's a fool.

520
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,323
But Manzo knows those samurai
better than anyone.

521
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,617
If he cut off his daughter's hair,
he must have good reason.

522
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,954
You've only got sons,
so you're safe, but we -

523
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:56,665
Goddamn it!
Now I understand.

524
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,752
So you agree to hide my daughter
at your place across the bridge?

525
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,880
Idiot! I meant that I see
what Manzo's up to.

526
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:10,303
That rascal doesn't care about the village,
only about his daughter.

527
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,055
Damn him!

528
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,368
Look what you've done!

529
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,871
Now the whole village is crazed.

530
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,331
Every family
with a girl's gone mad.

531
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,210
How do you plan
to set this right?

532
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,172
The samurai will show up
any day now.

533
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,051
Come on.
We're seeing the Old Man.

534
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:54,097
There's nothing to see here!
Go home!

535
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,767
Go home!

536
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:02,105
We can't let the samurai
see us like this.

537
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,864
He's still following us.

538
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,221
Where did Kikuchiyo go?

539
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,891
Think he gave up?

540
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,893
It's funny.

541
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,312
Now that he's gone,
it's almost a little...

542
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,480
Ionely.

543
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,030
This way.

544
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,284
Oh, hell!

545
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,799
So that's our castle, eh?

546
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,637
No way I'm gonna die
in that dungheap.

547
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:41,389
No one asked you to.

548
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:03,662
We're back!
The samurai have arrived!

549
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,710
The samurai are here!

550
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:19,052
What's wrong with you?
The samurai are here!

551
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,227
Hey, what's wrong?

552
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,066
What's the matter?

553
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:49,416
This is a fine welcome.

554
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,130
What's the meaning of this?

555
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,970
Hey, what's going on?
The samurai have arrived!

556
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,405
- We'll go see the Old Man.
- The Old Man?

557
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,575
Whatever happens in the village,
the Old Man -

558
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,827
He's the village elder?

559
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:31,833
An audience with the village elder.
This is truly an honor.

560
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,297
Well, let's go.

561
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:54,707
I know they're being foolish.

562
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:58,962
All farmers ever do is worry,

563
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:04,008
whether the rain falls,
the sun shines, or the wind blows.

564
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:06,428
In short,

565
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:10,598
all they know is fear.

566
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:14,602
Their behavior today...

567
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:19,774
is also due simply to fear.

568
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:27,532
But Old Man,
why do the villagers fear us?

569
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:32,245
What can they expect from us
under such circumstances?

570
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,694
Samurai, sirs!

571
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,947
Samurai, please!

572
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:28,051
Quiet down!

573
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:31,346
Don't panic. Calm down.

574
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,766
I want clear answers.

575
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,268
Where are the bandits
coming from?

576
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,730
- The mountains!
- No, the road!

577
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:47,195
Who saw the bandits?
Come forward.

578
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:49,656
No one saw any bandits?

579
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,367
Then who sounded the alarm?

580
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:53,826
<i>I did!</i>

581
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,669
Outta the way.

582
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,801
What's with the faces?

583
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,180
Don't worry.
No bandits have come.

584
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:21,229
Hey, blockheads.

585
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:25,066
Remember how you welcomed us
when we got here?

586
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,069
But as soon as I bang on this,

587
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,656
"Samurai, sirs!
Samurai, please!"

588
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,367
You're practically groveling!

589
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:41,874
Got what you deserved,
you mud snails.

590
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,186
Got a problem, gramps?

591
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:03,688
Nope.

592
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,232
All's well now.

593
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,532
Looks like he's good
for something after all.

594
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,327
There are seven of us at last.

595
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,502
Sorry it's so dirty.

596
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:30,548
But where will you sleep
if we take your home?

597
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:34,260
- In the barn.
- With your horse?

598
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:38,723
The bandits
got my horse last year.

599
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:59,661
A barn's not so bad
with a wife to snuggle up to.

600
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,167
I don't have a wife!

601
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,044
What's the matter, you fool?

602
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,140
Jerk.

603
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:37,365
By the way,
what's your real name?

604
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:41,119
I don't remember.

605
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,871
Give me a new one that fits.

606
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,541
Then Kikuchiyo it is.

607
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,877
Fits you perfectly.

608
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,900
How would you attack
this village?

609
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,653
I'd charge from this mountain.

610
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,407
I agree.
Along this road.

611
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,118
WEST

612
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:39,969
And what's the best defense?

613
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,388
Shichiroji knows what to do.

614
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:46,476
See these logs?
He'll make a fence to block the horses.

615
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:49,145
Indeed.
Your trusty right-hand man.

616
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,467
All right!

617
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,636
Listen.

618
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,764
Nothing forces you to run
like a battle.

619
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:28,142
You run when you attack,
you run when you retreat.

620
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,686
When you can't run anymore,
you die.

621
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,707
SOUTH

622
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:08,724
We'll flood these fields
after they harvest the barley.

623
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:13,604
That'll make a good defense.
But will we have time?

624
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,106
Indeed.

625
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,156
Charge!

626
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:29,287
Pretend I'm a bandit
and stab me.

627
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:33,916
Charge!

628
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:38,796
Come on!

629
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:49,223
Next.

630
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:52,476
Next.

631
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:54,896
What's wrong with all of you?

632
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:22,089
EAST

633
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:30,222
Destroying this bridge
will foil an assault from the east.

634
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:40,399
But what about the houses
on the other side?

635
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:50,326
They'll have to evacuate those.

636
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,791
And the mill?

637
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,921
The Old Man's
not going to go quietly.

638
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,972
Listen now.
The enemy is scary.

639
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,099
Everybody's scared.

640
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:16,769
But the other side's
scared of us too.

641
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,800
Just great.

642
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,512
You all make great scarecrows.

643
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:57,768
Problem is, the enemy
isn't a bunch of sparrows and crows!

644
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:09,905
You there, chewing your cud.
Can you cut that out?

645
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:16,078
This isn't a cow shed!

646
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,792
Look at the bunch of you.

647
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,380
Shit!

648
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,258
First in line, step forward!

649
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,679
I'm talking to you!

650
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:35,431
You!

651
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:58,954
Look here! You gotta pay
a mon each to watch the show!

652
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:19,600
What's this?

653
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,562
- A spear, sir.
- Idiot.

654
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:26,482
Where the hell
did you get it?

655
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,902
Did it sprout up in those hills?

656
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,781
I know perfectly well.

657
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,408
You hunted down retreating warriors
and took their weapons.

658
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:40,412
If you've got one,
you must have more.

659
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:44,917
Fess up, damn it!

660
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,178
NORTH

661
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,817
What a peaceful grove.
But it's also a death trap.

662
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:47,188
Katsushiro.

663
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,773
We're going.
- I'll be right there.

664
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,700
As I said,
he's still a child.

665
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:04,056
Are you from the village?

666
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:09,979
Are you a girl?

667
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,943
A boy?

668
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:19,780
Then where's your spear?

669
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:23,367
Is this any time for an able-bodied man
to be picking flowers?

670
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:26,537
Come here!
I'll teach you.

671
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,539
Come here!

672
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:34,628
Why, you!

673
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:42,321
This is fine, and this too.

674
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:44,406
But this is a problem.

675
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:47,493
<i>Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

676
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,748
Get back, the rest of you!

677
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,876
Stand up straight!

678
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,050
What a haul!

679
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,808
What's all this?

680
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:13,352
Plunder from defeated warriors.

681
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:16,897
Where did you find it?

682
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,067
Here in the village?
- Yep, over at Manzo's.

683
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:31,412
What's the matter?

684
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,249
Don't you like 'em?

685
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:39,920
This is good stuff.

686
01:27:41,464 --> 01:27:43,090
What's wrong?

687
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,677
You said you wanted armor,
spears and bows. Now you got 'em.

688
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:49,304
Bastard!
You call yourself a samurai?

689
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:53,600
Those farmers killed samurai
to get these.

690
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:55,769
- I know that.
- Then why the hell -

691
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,771
That's enough!

692
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:02,776
You can't understand
unless you've been hunted.

693
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:18,292
It's nothing.
Get outta here.

694
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:46,487
Now I want to kill them all.

695
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,294
Well, that's just fine and dandy!

696
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:09,259
What did ya think
these farmers were anyway?

697
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:12,012
Buddhas or something?

698
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:14,139
Don't make me laugh!

699
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:16,767
There's no creature on earth
as wily as a farmer!

700
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,484
Ask 'em for rice, barley,
anything,

701
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:28,028
and all they ever say is,
"We're all out."

702
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:33,742
But they've got it.
They've got everything.

703
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:38,705
Dig under the floorboards.
If it's not there, try the barn.

704
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:44,378
You'll find plenty.
Jars of rice, salt, beans, sake!

705
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,553
Go up in the mountains.
They have hidden fields.

706
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,764
They kowtow and lie,
playing innocent the whole time.

707
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:58,392
You name it,
they'll cheat you on it!

708
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,603
After a battle, they hunt down
the losers with their spears.

709
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,148
Listen to me!

710
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:08,902
Farmers are misers, weasels,

711
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,320
and crybabies!

712
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:12,906
They're mean, stupid

713
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,866
murderers!

714
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:18,203
Damn!
I could laugh till I cry!

715
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:25,669
But tell me this:
Who turned them into such monsters?

716
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,339
You did!
You samurai did!

717
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:31,592
Damn you to hell!

718
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,267
In war, you burn their villages,

719
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,604
trample their fields,
steal their food,

720
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:47,441
work them like slaves,
rape their women,

721
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,276
and kill 'em if they resist.

722
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:51,320
What do you expect 'em to do?

723
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:53,822
What the hell are farmers
supposed to do?

724
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,491
Damn it! Goddamn it!

725
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,908
You were born a farmer,
weren't you?

726
01:32:15,446 --> 01:32:18,782
What is it now?

727
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:22,911
Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.

728
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,145
It's me.

729
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:32,439
I'm sleeping here
from now on.

730
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:35,442
Those guys cramp my style.

731
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:40,280
Idiot! Stop cowering!

732
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:42,991
This is your place!

733
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:46,328
You hand over your house
and sleep in a barn,

734
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:48,330
and still you can't stand up
for yourself.

735
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,040
Get to sleep!

736
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,600
Brings back memories.

737
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:28,954
Sure is quiet.

738
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:37,170
On a day like this, it's hard
to imagine bandits on that mountain.

739
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:42,217
Damn it all,
I need a girl!

740
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,519
- Where are you going?
- The hills.

741
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:54,813
- The hills?
- To practice.

742
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,066
No girls up there.

743
01:34:59,735 --> 01:35:02,529
Sometimes you really
hit the nail on the head.

744
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:05,949
What are you making there?

745
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:08,076
- A flag.
- A flag?

746
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:14,457
It doesn't feel right in battle
without a banner to raise high.

747
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:21,006
What do the symbols mean?

748
01:35:21,173 --> 01:35:26,011
This represents a field:
That is, the farmers and this village.

749
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:29,306
- And those circles?
- Those are us.

750
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:32,893
There's only six.
You leaving me out?

751
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:36,187
No, this triangle's Lord Kikuchiyo.

752
01:35:36,355 --> 01:35:38,231
That's a good one!

753
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:01,147
It's real rice.

754
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,358
Go ahead. Eat.
- But -

755
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:05,735
Rikichi gave me some millet.

756
01:37:05,903 --> 01:37:10,240
I could barely get it down.

757
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,035
Go ahead. Eat.

758
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:26,798
Hurry up and eat.

759
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:28,842
If you're embarrassed, I'll go.

760
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:30,885
I'm not going to eat it.

761
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,346
Why not?
I went to a lot of trouble.

762
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,432
No, I just -

763
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:41,980
I know you did, so I'll take it
to Kyuemon's grandma.

764
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:44,941
Kyuemon's grandma?

765
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:09,883
Rikichi, I'm full.
I'll save the rest for later.

766
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:13,011
Go ahead and eat.

767
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,221
Take my leftovers this time.

768
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:19,809
What's this?
What are you up to?

769
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:21,561
What's going on?

770
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,404
How terrible.

771
01:38:32,823 --> 01:38:36,951
Doesn't she have family?
- The bandits got them all.

772
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:44,918
I...

773
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:50,548
want to die quickly.

774
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:54,969
I want to die soon

775
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:59,432
and leave this suffering behind.

776
01:39:00,976 --> 01:39:03,394
But you know...

777
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:08,358
the other world may be

778
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:12,695
just as full of suffering
as this one.

779
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:16,282
It's not.

780
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:20,829
In that world
there's no war and no bandits.

781
01:39:21,163 --> 01:39:23,373
There's no suffering there,
grandma.

782
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:27,168
How the hell would you know?
Have you been there?

783
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:29,129
Why the hell
are you always screaming?

784
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:31,005
I hate wimps.

785
01:39:31,173 --> 01:39:33,842
Worms like her make me sick!

786
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,513
Pissing and grumbling
about everything.

787
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:42,976
Shit!
I want to do something wild!

788
01:39:43,185 --> 01:39:47,105
Save your spit and fire
for the bandits.

789
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,664
Excuse me.

790
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:09,752
Excuse me, but why did you -

791
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:12,755
You saw us today, didn't you?

792
01:40:12,923 --> 01:40:15,425
Me and the -

793
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:17,594
- The girl?
- Yes.

794
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:22,348
Why didn't you -
- Tell them? You want me to?

795
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:41,993
We want rice!
White rice!

796
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:50,376
You little brats!
There's no rice!

797
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:58,092
Quit yapping!

798
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:03,264
If you've got the strength
to scream, "We want rice!"

799
01:41:03,432 --> 01:41:05,850
Then you don't need it!

800
01:41:06,227 --> 01:41:09,103
Listen here,
you little piss pants.

801
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:13,399
This is all the rice there is.

802
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:16,778
If we give you any more,
we'll get all -

803
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:21,950
That's how it is.

804
01:41:22,117 --> 01:41:25,912
Say, any of you got
a pretty sister?

805
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:32,085
How about you?
You got one?

806
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:35,922
So, Old Man,
when is the harvest?

807
01:41:38,259 --> 01:41:40,093
In ten days.

808
01:41:40,261 --> 01:41:42,553
How quickly can you do it?

809
01:41:44,556 --> 01:41:47,433
No less than three days.

810
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:50,561
We'll flood the fields
when you're done.

811
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:54,565
You see, we want to create
a moat to the south of the village.

812
01:41:54,733 --> 01:41:56,901
It'll keep the horses out.

813
01:41:57,069 --> 01:42:00,446
We don't need all the fields.
One patch per family will do.

814
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:02,115
Then...

815
01:42:02,616 --> 01:42:06,953
it'll take at least a day to flatten
the paths and draw the water.

816
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,497
Understood.

817
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:12,125
There's one other thing.

818
01:42:12,584 --> 01:42:18,881
You need to leave the houses this side
of the bridge, and the mill too.

819
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:21,759
Father!

820
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:24,178
You want us to move out?

821
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:33,813
I know it's tough.

822
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:37,567
But there's no choice.

823
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:43,114
We can't possibly protect
the outlying houses.

824
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:07,597
Listen carefully. You'll soon
begin harvesting the barley.

825
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:09,807
The bandits will come
when you're done.

826
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:11,851
We have to assume that.

827
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:15,813
Therefore we prepare
for battle as we harvest.

828
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:19,734
We'll harvest not as families
but as squads.

829
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:24,530
Starting tomorrow,
each squad will live and work as one.

830
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:29,619
Understood? Starting tomorrow,
nobody acts on his own.

831
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:32,789
Hey, everybody.

832
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:38,378
Give your wives
plenty of lovin' tonight, you hear?

833
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:02,068
This is all a load of crap!

834
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:05,071
Everyone from across the bridge,
follow me.

835
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:09,867
Throw down your spears.

836
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:14,080
Why should we abandon
our homes to protect theirs?

837
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:18,543
That's right.
We'll protect our homes ourselves.

838
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:22,213
Stop!

839
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,176
Pick up your spears!

840
01:44:27,803 --> 01:44:29,303
Return to your line!

841
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:57,373
Fall in!

842
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:00,543
Squad formation!

843
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:06,007
Where's Yohei gone?

844
01:45:07,384 --> 01:45:09,135
Where the hell's Yohei?

845
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:17,727
There you are, you idiot!

846
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:37,538
There are three outlying houses,

847
01:45:38,373 --> 01:45:40,458
but 20 in the village.

848
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:45,254
We can't risk 20
to save three.

849
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:50,843
And if this village is destroyed,

850
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:53,888
those three cannot survive
on their own.

851
01:45:57,935 --> 01:46:01,437
Is that clear?
This is the nature of war:

852
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:05,775
By protecting others,
you save yourself.

853
01:46:07,736 --> 01:46:10,238
If you only think of yourself,

854
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:12,907
you'll only destroy yourself.

855
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:19,789
From this day forward,
anyone caught doing that...

856
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,986
INTERMISSION

857
01:52:49,471 --> 01:52:51,096
Hot damn!

858
01:52:51,264 --> 01:52:53,098
Look at all those girls!

859
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:54,725
Hey, Yohei!

860
01:53:00,273 --> 01:53:03,067
Where the hell
have you been hiding these girls?

861
01:53:07,364 --> 01:53:09,156
You devil.

862
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:19,249
Hey, lend me your scythe.

863
01:53:20,418 --> 01:53:22,461
I'll cut three times your share.

864
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:25,673
In return,
we get nice and friendly, eh?

865
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:51,156
- Rikichi.
- Yes.

866
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:56,036
It seems the married couples
are the most productive.

867
01:53:56,705 --> 01:53:58,872
Time you got yourself a wife.

868
01:54:02,252 --> 01:54:06,422
Why do you always get so mad?
I just said you should -

869
01:54:07,632 --> 01:54:09,925
Katsushiro, go after him.

870
01:54:10,093 --> 01:54:12,219
Running off at a time like this.

871
01:54:13,388 --> 01:54:14,847
Rikichi!

872
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:17,307
Rikichi!

873
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:24,189
Shino, what are you gawking at?

874
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:43,500
What's this? A bear's den?

875
01:54:45,503 --> 01:54:47,671
This was done with a scythe.

876
01:54:49,799 --> 01:54:51,133
Was it Rikichi?

877
01:54:51,718 --> 01:54:54,219
Yes, though I didn't actually
see him do it.

878
01:54:54,387 --> 01:54:56,597
I lost him for a while,

879
01:54:56,765 --> 01:54:58,682
but then I spotted him
leaving this grove.

880
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:02,019
He was furious,
soaked in sweat.

881
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:07,274
What did you say to him?

882
01:55:07,442 --> 01:55:10,944
Nothing. Just that he should
hurry up and find a wife.

883
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:18,452
Something's upsetting the little bugger,
but he won't say what.

884
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:21,330
You can see it
all over his face.

885
01:55:22,123 --> 01:55:27,711
Those lips of his
are bolted up tight as a house.

886
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:30,297
Why don't you try to open them up?

887
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:38,597
Who's there?

888
01:55:38,765 --> 01:55:40,057
<i>It's me.</i>

889
01:55:42,393 --> 01:55:44,937
All clear?
- Yes.

890
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:56,323
Have a seat.
Let's have a little chat.

891
01:56:01,496 --> 01:56:05,040
I think talking...

892
01:56:05,708 --> 01:56:07,584
is a good thing.

893
01:56:08,128 --> 01:56:12,172
Whatever your burden may be,
talking can ease it.

894
01:56:15,343 --> 01:56:19,263
You, for example,
seem pretty tight-lipped,

895
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:24,393
but if you're suffering,
you shouldn't bottle it up.

896
01:56:27,147 --> 01:56:31,692
Letting out your feelings
bit by bit can work wonders.

897
01:56:32,902 --> 01:56:35,571
I've got nothing to say.

898
01:56:53,173 --> 01:56:55,048
Time to head out.

899
01:56:57,552 --> 01:56:58,635
Shall we wake him?

900
01:56:58,803 --> 01:57:01,013
No, let the kid sleep.

901
01:57:04,934 --> 01:57:06,393
Shino.

902
01:57:09,147 --> 01:57:11,231
I swear he just said "Shino."

903
01:57:14,235 --> 01:57:16,111
Sounds like a woman's name.

904
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:19,114
Even kids can be charmers
in their dreams.

905
01:57:25,496 --> 01:57:28,040
Where shall we start our rounds?

906
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:31,418
The place that worries us most,
of course.

907
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:30,269
Who's there?

908
01:58:37,068 --> 01:58:38,610
Who's there?

909
01:58:39,153 --> 01:58:40,821
Come out here!

910
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:42,531
Who's there?

911
01:58:42,699 --> 01:58:44,157
Kikuchiyo.

912
01:58:46,494 --> 01:58:48,578
You're lucky it was us.

913
01:58:48,955 --> 01:58:52,124
If we'd been bandits,
you'd be headless right now.

914
01:59:24,115 --> 01:59:25,657
Yohei.

915
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:28,744
What's this?

916
01:59:29,037 --> 01:59:31,163
That's my horse, sir.

917
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:36,293
I thought it was a big old mouse.

918
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:20,003
<i>The sparrows chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

919
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:24,758
<i>The crows caw, caw, caw</i>

920
02:00:28,554 --> 02:00:31,848
I wonder why
the bandits aren't coming.

921
02:00:34,143 --> 02:00:39,606
What a waste if they don't.
Think how much we feed those samurai.

922
02:00:39,774 --> 02:00:43,568
Idiot!
It's best if they don't come!

923
02:00:50,118 --> 02:00:53,370
A nag like that
can't carry your weight!

924
02:00:53,538 --> 02:00:56,832
Yohei's horse is too worn out.

925
02:00:58,918 --> 02:01:02,045
Please stop. Yohei'll be in tears
if you break its leg.

926
02:01:02,213 --> 02:01:05,799
A skilled horseman
can make even a nag soar into the sky.

927
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:19,020
Not bad.

928
02:01:34,745 --> 02:01:36,705
Very fine indeed!

929
02:02:00,688 --> 02:02:02,772
They seem to be having fun.

930
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:07,194
The threshing's done,
and still no bandits.

931
02:02:07,612 --> 02:02:11,031
Everyone's saying
they might not come after all.

932
02:02:12,241 --> 02:02:14,534
A tempting thought.

933
02:02:15,036 --> 02:02:20,248
But when you think you're safe
is precisely when you're most vulnerable.

934
02:02:21,542 --> 02:02:23,960
Send them back
to their posts.

935
02:02:57,411 --> 02:03:01,164
I wish I'd been born
into a samurai family.

936
02:03:04,252 --> 02:03:06,253
A farmer's life is too cruel.

937
02:03:07,338 --> 02:03:10,423
My life has been so easy,
I'm ashamed.

938
02:03:10,591 --> 02:03:12,926
That's not what I meant.

939
02:03:13,261 --> 02:03:17,764
It's because you're a samurai
and I'm a farmer.

940
02:03:17,932 --> 02:03:19,391
But I don't -

941
02:03:19,559 --> 02:03:22,811
It's all right. I don't mind.
We can't know

942
02:03:22,979 --> 02:03:25,188
what the future holds!

943
02:03:58,472 --> 02:04:01,725
Coward!
Act like a samurai!

944
02:05:08,751 --> 02:05:11,544
Three suspicious characters
on the western road.

945
02:05:13,964 --> 02:05:16,758
- The villagers haven't noticed?
- Not yet.

946
02:05:16,926 --> 02:05:19,010
We can't have them
sounding the alarm.

947
02:05:21,389 --> 02:05:24,307
I saw three horses
up in the hills.

948
02:05:24,475 --> 02:05:27,394
I think they're bandits.
- We know.

949
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:34,317
- So they're here.
- How did you know?

950
02:05:34,485 --> 02:05:37,696
How could I not?
This one here was in such a panic.

951
02:05:41,075 --> 02:05:43,743
Where are they coming from?
The mountains or the west?

952
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:47,580
The west.

953
02:05:56,257 --> 02:05:57,132
Bandits!

954
02:06:01,637 --> 02:06:04,764
Send everyone to their houses.
There are only three of them.

955
02:06:04,932 --> 02:06:07,726
Tell them to keep quiet
no matter what.

956
02:06:07,893 --> 02:06:12,272
They're probably scouts.
We can't let them see any samurai.

957
02:06:29,457 --> 02:06:31,624
What is it?

958
02:06:32,001 --> 02:06:33,793
Bandits?

959
02:06:36,464 --> 02:06:39,507
Bandits, eh?
Where are they?

960
02:06:51,145 --> 02:06:52,479
Quiet!

961
02:06:54,482 --> 02:06:56,357
Where are they, Shichiroji?

962
02:06:56,525 --> 02:06:59,277
Beyond the fence.

963
02:07:13,667 --> 02:07:16,252
No doubt about it - they're scouts.

964
02:07:16,754 --> 02:07:18,671
The fence took them by surprise.

965
02:07:19,757 --> 02:07:22,175
They don't seem
to realize we're here.

966
02:07:22,343 --> 02:07:25,470
With luck they'll report
there are only farmers here.

967
02:07:27,014 --> 02:07:29,599
<i>Hey, where is everyone?</i>

968
02:07:29,767 --> 02:07:31,476
That idiot!

969
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,437
Kikuchiyo!

970
02:07:40,653 --> 02:07:43,029
Hey, I hear the bandits are here.

971
02:07:44,698 --> 02:07:45,490
You fool.

972
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:47,992
Too late.
They've seen us.

973
02:07:58,838 --> 02:08:02,382
If they report back that samurai
are here, we're finished.

974
02:08:03,217 --> 02:08:06,386
I'll kill them.
The mountain's my territory.

975
02:08:06,679 --> 02:08:07,720
I was just -

976
02:08:07,888 --> 02:08:11,683
Enough. You can make up for it
by getting one.

977
02:08:11,851 --> 02:08:13,226
Head them off at -

978
02:08:13,394 --> 02:08:16,271
I know, at their horses.
Take us there.

979
02:08:17,398 --> 02:08:19,023
Katsushiro!

980
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:22,402
Just watch, you understand?

981
02:08:29,451 --> 02:08:31,661
Those are some horses!

982
02:08:36,458 --> 02:08:38,376
Wait in this hollow.

983
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:49,971
- What do you plan to do?
- Who, me?

984
02:10:50,384 --> 02:10:52,552
Katsushiro.

985
02:10:53,387 --> 02:10:55,596
You can come out now.

986
02:10:58,892 --> 02:11:00,768
Help me!

987
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:21,581
Back off!

988
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:27,170
He's a captive who has confessed.
He's begging for his life.

989
02:11:27,337 --> 02:11:30,798
You can't just
chop him to pieces.

990
02:11:32,092 --> 02:11:33,342
Stay out of this!

991
02:11:35,095 --> 02:11:37,305
Let me do it! Scum!

992
02:11:55,365 --> 02:11:57,158
All right.

993
02:11:57,618 --> 02:12:00,286
Let her avenge her son's death.

994
02:12:02,581 --> 02:12:05,333
Someone help her!

995
02:12:05,501 --> 02:12:07,126
I'll do it!

996
02:12:15,969 --> 02:12:19,764
- That bandit said their fort -
- It's hardly a fort.

997
02:12:19,932 --> 02:12:23,810
It's full of holes,
like Yohei's underwear.

998
02:12:23,977 --> 02:12:26,312
- Easy to sneak in.
- Let's attack at night.

999
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:30,066
They have 40 men.
We'd usually pick off a few first.

1000
02:12:30,234 --> 02:12:33,194
Wait. We can't afford
to lose a single man,

1001
02:12:33,362 --> 02:12:35,822
even if we kill five
for every one lost.

1002
02:12:35,989 --> 02:12:40,535
- War is always a gamble.
- Three of us can take 10 of them.

1003
02:12:41,537 --> 02:12:43,079
Rikichi.

1004
02:12:43,247 --> 02:12:46,207
How far away is their hideout?

1005
02:12:46,375 --> 02:12:47,875
At least a day.

1006
02:12:48,043 --> 02:12:50,878
Hey, we've got
three of their horses.

1007
02:12:51,046 --> 02:12:53,172
Half a day by horse.

1008
02:13:05,185 --> 02:13:06,811
Very well. Let's do it.

1009
02:13:06,979 --> 02:13:09,939
If we leave now,
we'll arrive before dawn.

1010
02:13:10,107 --> 02:13:11,858
But who should go?

1011
02:13:15,028 --> 02:13:16,195
Not you.

1012
02:13:18,907 --> 02:13:21,242
And me makes three.

1013
02:13:22,119 --> 02:13:24,036
They need a guide!

1014
02:13:24,204 --> 02:13:26,622
There aren't enough horses.

1015
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:28,875
There's Yohei's horse.
You ride that.

1016
02:13:29,042 --> 02:13:31,252
The only man
to master that steed

1017
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:33,045
is Lord Kikuchiyo himself.

1018
02:13:42,097 --> 02:13:44,307
Whoa! What the hell?

1019
02:13:45,142 --> 02:13:47,351
It's the other way!

1020
02:13:49,771 --> 02:13:51,647
Stupid horse!

1021
02:13:52,274 --> 02:13:56,235
This way, you useless mule!

1022
02:13:56,987 --> 02:13:59,572
You call yourself a horse?

1023
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:01,908
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

1024
02:14:03,785 --> 02:14:05,620
Hey, wait!

1025
02:14:07,915 --> 02:14:11,751
Please stop! I apologize!

1026
02:14:11,919 --> 02:14:13,419
I'm sorry!

1027
02:15:39,965 --> 02:15:42,425
Hey, let's set the place on fire!

1028
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:44,510
Cut 'em down as they run out!

1029
02:18:18,832 --> 02:18:20,833
Serves you right!

1030
02:18:21,460 --> 02:18:23,210
We did it!

1031
02:18:25,672 --> 02:18:27,631
Take that, you sons of bitches!

1032
02:19:10,634 --> 02:19:11,967
Heihachi!

1033
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:35,115
Are you crazy?

1034
02:19:50,882 --> 02:19:52,132
Stupid idiot!

1035
02:19:52,300 --> 02:19:55,553
Look what you've done!
Who is she to you?

1036
02:19:56,930 --> 02:19:59,265
She's my wife!

1037
02:20:02,852 --> 02:20:05,604
Heihachi, hang on!

1038
02:20:44,811 --> 02:20:46,478
You said...

1039
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:51,483
he'd be a treasure
in hard times.

1040
02:20:53,236 --> 02:20:55,613
The hard times
have only just begun.

1041
02:21:05,707 --> 02:21:06,999
Stop crying!

1042
02:21:07,667 --> 02:21:09,752
Damn fool!

1043
02:21:11,004 --> 02:21:12,671
Stop crying!

1044
02:22:40,552 --> 02:22:42,678
Goddamn!
Here they come!

1045
02:23:55,877 --> 02:23:59,671
Take note:
They have three muskets.

1046
02:24:25,323 --> 02:24:27,533
Twenty riders bound north,
13 south.

1047
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:29,868
- Muskets?
- Three in all.

1048
02:24:31,037 --> 02:24:34,039
Take the south, and watch out
for those muskets.

1049
02:25:30,346 --> 02:25:32,681
Retreat! Retreat!

1050
02:25:48,281 --> 02:25:51,825
- The 12 headed south have turned east.
- Wasn't that 13?

1051
02:25:52,035 --> 02:25:53,994
An arrow got one of them.

1052
02:25:54,162 --> 02:25:55,746
Good old Gorobei.

1053
02:25:58,499 --> 02:26:01,793
Make sure the eastern bridge is out,
and watch out for -

1054
02:26:01,961 --> 02:26:03,503
The muskets!

1055
02:26:12,555 --> 02:26:16,141
Take the north.
That's where we'll battle it out.

1056
02:26:17,101 --> 02:26:20,562
If you knew that, why didn't
you build a fence there too?

1057
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:23,148
Every great castle
needs a breach.

1058
02:26:23,316 --> 02:26:27,611
Draw the enemy there and attack.
You can't win by defense alone.

1059
02:26:39,332 --> 02:26:41,500
Use your balls,
if you've got any!

1060
02:26:45,588 --> 02:26:48,131
Take it away, damn it!

1061
02:26:51,678 --> 02:26:54,388
Twelve riders are on the way.
Hurry with the bridge!

1062
02:26:54,597 --> 02:26:57,307
Are you blind?
What do you think we're doing?

1063
02:26:59,227 --> 02:27:01,645
And he said
to watch out for the muskets.

1064
02:27:01,813 --> 02:27:03,855
What kinda idiot
you take me for?

1065
02:27:10,446 --> 02:27:11,822
Where are you going?

1066
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:14,825
We're looking for Father.
We can't find him anywhere.

1067
02:27:15,118 --> 02:27:19,705
Father intends to die in that barn.
That's what he's always wanted.

1068
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:27,587
Stubborn old fool!

1069
02:27:28,089 --> 02:27:30,298
Hurry up and get him!

1070
02:27:33,886 --> 02:27:35,929
Get out of our way!

1071
02:27:36,889 --> 02:27:40,225
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

1072
02:28:01,998 --> 02:28:04,332
- On this mountain -
- Twenty riders.

1073
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:07,335
And 12 to the east.

1074
02:28:07,503 --> 02:28:08,920
Right.

1075
02:28:24,729 --> 02:28:27,856
This won't do.
They're all scared stiff.

1076
02:28:31,694 --> 02:28:33,278
Good! Again!

1077
02:28:34,864 --> 02:28:36,448
Again!

1078
02:28:39,744 --> 02:28:42,954
Shichiroji's at it.
Let's fire ours up too.

1079
02:28:44,457 --> 02:28:46,166
Everybody out here!

1080
02:28:51,422 --> 02:28:53,924
Raise your spears
and give the battle cry.

1081
02:28:58,554 --> 02:28:59,471
Again!

1082
02:29:03,810 --> 02:29:06,770
Damn 'em, listen to that!
We can beat 'em!

1083
02:29:10,650 --> 02:29:13,318
Yohei, what's that look for?
Again!

1084
02:29:18,491 --> 02:29:20,450
Take cover!

1085
02:29:25,164 --> 02:29:27,040
Here they come!

1086
02:29:43,683 --> 02:29:45,100
Goddamn 'em!

1087
02:30:21,387 --> 02:30:24,514
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

1088
02:30:28,895 --> 02:30:31,104
Oh, no, you don't!

1089
02:30:35,902 --> 02:30:37,485
Don't panic!

1090
02:30:46,412 --> 02:30:48,830
Goddamn you!

1091
02:30:52,919 --> 02:30:54,377
They're burning!

1092
02:30:54,754 --> 02:30:56,671
Damn bastards!

1093
02:31:26,452 --> 02:31:29,537
Back to your posts, everyone!

1094
02:31:30,706 --> 02:31:32,415
Dear!

1095
02:31:34,335 --> 02:31:37,087
They're just rickety shacks!

1096
02:31:40,007 --> 02:31:43,009
Everybody, back to your posts!

1097
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:56,022
Goddamn it!

1098
02:31:57,733 --> 02:31:59,484
You dogs!

1099
02:31:59,735 --> 02:32:02,320
That's the Old Man's house!

1100
02:32:04,865 --> 02:32:07,575
Where's the Old Man?
What about that couple?

1101
02:32:08,035 --> 02:32:11,037
And the little brat?
What the hell's going on?

1102
02:32:14,125 --> 02:32:17,085
Stop!
You can't abandon your post!

1103
02:32:19,005 --> 02:32:21,089
Kikuchiyo, come back!

1104
02:32:23,175 --> 02:32:24,676
Kikuchiyo!

1105
02:32:39,859 --> 02:32:42,652
Where's the Old Man
and your husband?

1106
02:32:52,621 --> 02:32:55,582
She's been speared.
How'd she make it this far?

1107
02:33:02,048 --> 02:33:03,965
Let's go!

1108
02:33:10,556 --> 02:33:12,682
Damn it, what is it now?

1109
02:33:15,895 --> 02:33:18,563
This baby... is me.

1110
02:33:19,065 --> 02:33:21,566
This is just
what happened to me!

1111
02:34:30,344 --> 02:34:32,262
Here we go!

1112
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:43,064
What the hell?

1113
02:34:57,329 --> 02:34:59,831
What the hell
were you staring at?

1114
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,584
Idiot!

1115
02:36:04,897 --> 02:36:06,940
No one wounded?

1116
02:36:07,316 --> 02:36:09,776
Good.
You did a fine job.

1117
02:36:09,944 --> 02:36:11,611
Fine job!

1118
02:36:14,949 --> 02:36:17,200
Gunpowder!
Take cover!

1119
02:36:27,711 --> 02:36:29,420
Manzo!

1120
02:36:43,185 --> 02:36:45,144
Where were you hit?

1121
02:36:45,646 --> 02:36:48,815
Shino! Shino!
Bring me my daughter.

1122
02:36:50,025 --> 02:36:51,442
Don't bother.

1123
02:36:51,819 --> 02:36:54,737
If this kills you,
you'd die of a fleabite.

1124
02:36:55,948 --> 02:36:58,533
You make a ruckus
over a little scratch

1125
02:36:58,701 --> 02:37:02,579
and blow your daughter's cover
in the process. Nice going!

1126
02:37:31,942 --> 02:37:34,193
You don't have
to chase them all down.

1127
02:37:37,656 --> 02:37:39,699
That's far enough.
Well done.

1128
02:37:40,451 --> 02:37:42,368
Who are you?

1129
02:37:44,246 --> 02:37:45,997
Rikichi.

1130
02:38:00,971 --> 02:38:03,514
They've attacked from the east,
west and south

1131
02:38:03,682 --> 02:38:06,643
and run away each time
with their tails between their legs.

1132
02:38:06,810 --> 02:38:08,561
This is the only approach left.

1133
02:38:08,729 --> 02:38:11,356
We don't know
if they'll come tonight,

1134
02:38:11,523 --> 02:38:13,650
but when they do,
they'll mass their forces here.

1135
02:38:13,817 --> 02:38:15,526
Perhaps, but...

1136
02:38:16,195 --> 02:38:18,279
I don't hear a thing.

1137
02:38:31,377 --> 02:38:33,086
Nevertheless,

1138
02:38:33,837 --> 02:38:36,172
this will surely
be the focus of their attack.

1139
02:38:36,590 --> 02:38:38,549
I'll prove it to you in a minute.

1140
02:39:22,553 --> 02:39:23,928
Good work.

1141
02:39:24,096 --> 02:39:27,140
Now poke that scarecrow out
from behind those trees.

1142
02:40:01,675 --> 02:40:04,802
I'd say tomorrow morning

1143
02:40:05,095 --> 02:40:07,597
they'll attack us here
with everything they've got.

1144
02:40:07,765 --> 02:40:10,683
And we'll let them in.

1145
02:40:14,605 --> 02:40:17,774
Don't worry.
I mean we'll let one in.

1146
02:40:18,817 --> 02:40:20,818
Two at most.

1147
02:40:21,820 --> 02:40:25,490
Once they're in,
we form a wall again with our spears.

1148
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:29,076
The one or two who get in
are as good as dead.

1149
02:40:29,244 --> 02:40:31,329
We can cook 'em up
any way we want.

1150
02:40:33,582 --> 02:40:38,169
We'll pick them off patiently,
one by one, until the final showdown.

1151
02:40:38,337 --> 02:40:40,379
Those muskets worry me.

1152
02:40:40,547 --> 02:40:42,715
If only we could
get one of them.

1153
02:40:45,302 --> 02:40:48,679
I'll go.
I swear I'll get one!

1154
02:40:48,847 --> 02:40:51,766
No. You're looking to die.
I'll go.

1155
02:41:44,903 --> 02:41:46,821
Footsteps! Listen!

1156
02:41:46,989 --> 02:41:50,241
That's enough.
Get some rest.

1157
02:41:50,409 --> 02:41:53,411
It's true! I hear them!
Listen.

1158
02:41:53,579 --> 02:41:55,705
I said enough.

1159
02:41:56,582 --> 02:41:59,709
You're exhausted.
Get some rest.

1160
02:42:02,462 --> 02:42:04,171
I hear them.

1161
02:42:32,326 --> 02:42:34,076
Two more down.

1162
02:43:09,071 --> 02:43:10,279
What is it?

1163
02:43:13,367 --> 02:43:17,495
State your business.
I'm going to get some sleep.

1164
02:43:18,956 --> 02:43:22,458
You are a magnificent person.

1165
02:43:26,838 --> 02:43:30,883
I've wanted to tell you so
for some time.

1166
02:43:56,868 --> 02:43:58,619
They're here.

1167
02:44:02,708 --> 02:44:04,709
We'll let one in.

1168
02:44:07,504 --> 02:44:09,463
We're letting one in!

1169
02:44:16,888 --> 02:44:21,392
Remember, after the first one's in,
jump out with your spears.

1170
02:44:40,287 --> 02:44:41,537
Here they come.

1171
02:45:17,491 --> 02:45:19,241
Step aside!

1172
02:45:21,787 --> 02:45:23,329
Good work.

1173
02:45:31,046 --> 02:45:34,131
What's wrong? You did well.

1174
02:45:34,633 --> 02:45:36,550
Here he comes! Scatter!

1175
02:45:54,111 --> 02:45:56,320
Fall back! Fall back!

1176
02:46:01,952 --> 02:46:04,036
After them!

1177
02:46:12,337 --> 02:46:14,004
Another on the way!

1178
02:47:56,316 --> 02:47:58,067
Here he comes.

1179
02:48:14,292 --> 02:48:16,126
Watch this!

1180
02:48:22,050 --> 02:48:24,760
Having fun with your horsey?

1181
02:48:46,533 --> 02:48:51,078
They've stopped.
Won't fall for that trick again, eh?

1182
02:49:00,005 --> 02:49:03,173
They're all wimps!
Who's scared of bandits anyway?

1183
02:49:10,098 --> 02:49:15,352
That little skirmish just cost them four.
Kyuzo got two last night.

1184
02:49:31,953 --> 02:49:34,204
That man is a true samurai.

1185
02:49:34,539 --> 02:49:37,207
He's fearless,
his swordsmanship is amazing,

1186
02:49:37,375 --> 02:49:39,084
and yet he's kind too.

1187
02:49:39,252 --> 02:49:42,963
He never once boasted
about capturing that musket.

1188
02:49:43,381 --> 02:49:47,885
He walked into a forest filled with bandits
as if on a mushroom hunt.

1189
02:49:49,262 --> 02:49:53,557
Fascinating.
I'm not bored at all, I swear.

1190
02:50:11,409 --> 02:50:13,327
Hey, Yohei.

1191
02:50:14,204 --> 02:50:15,746
Take over for me.

1192
02:50:18,875 --> 02:50:21,919
What's that face for?

1193
02:50:22,087 --> 02:50:24,254
There's no danger here now.

1194
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:28,008
You make a great scarecrow.

1195
02:51:59,476 --> 02:52:00,767
Hear me good!

1196
02:52:01,853 --> 02:52:04,229
If anybody else turns yellow -

1197
02:52:10,403 --> 02:52:11,778
Out of my way!

1198
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:36,530
Hey!

1199
02:53:40,285 --> 02:53:41,451
How's it goin'?

1200
02:53:41,619 --> 02:53:43,662
Man, they're a pain.

1201
02:53:43,955 --> 02:53:46,081
Won't be long now.

1202
02:53:46,499 --> 02:53:49,751
Everything's upside down.

1203
02:53:49,961 --> 02:53:53,797
They burn us out,
and we starve like farmers.

1204
02:53:54,632 --> 02:53:57,467
Quit your moaning.
There are better times ahead.

1205
02:53:57,635 --> 02:53:59,970
Do your part, man.

1206
02:54:39,677 --> 02:54:41,845
Hey, it's me!

1207
02:54:49,103 --> 02:54:50,854
Serves you right, you dogs!

1208
02:54:51,022 --> 02:54:52,022
Fool!

1209
02:54:53,191 --> 02:54:55,192
Why did you leave your post?

1210
02:54:55,360 --> 02:54:56,735
Just look at this!

1211
02:54:56,903 --> 02:55:00,530
Don't scold me, man.
My post is fine.

1212
02:55:01,366 --> 02:55:04,910
There's nothing heroic
about selfishly grabbing for glory.

1213
02:55:05,078 --> 02:55:09,289
Listen to me:
War is not fought alone!

1214
02:55:19,676 --> 02:55:22,719
Gorobei and Kyuzo,
guard this post!

1215
02:55:28,101 --> 02:55:30,143
Let no one pass!

1216
02:57:38,064 --> 02:57:40,857
Stop, you asses!

1217
02:57:41,025 --> 02:57:42,734
Damn you!

1218
02:57:43,361 --> 02:57:45,362
Damn it! Two made it in!

1219
02:58:01,045 --> 02:58:04,089
Goddamn it!

1220
02:58:04,799 --> 02:58:06,383
Where's Yohei?

1221
02:58:46,382 --> 02:58:47,716
Yohei!

1222
02:58:49,343 --> 02:58:50,760
Yohei!

1223
02:58:51,262 --> 02:58:54,389
I defended my post.

1224
02:58:54,557 --> 02:58:57,225
Don't give up, Yohei!

1225
02:59:00,605 --> 02:59:02,439
Go ahead, shoot me!

1226
02:59:40,478 --> 02:59:42,187
Shichiroji, take over!

1227
02:59:53,449 --> 02:59:55,325
Gorobei!

1228
03:00:05,002 --> 03:00:07,003
Gorobei!

1229
03:00:58,931 --> 03:01:01,224
Just 13 left.

1230
03:01:01,809 --> 03:01:03,852
But these last seven...

1231
03:01:05,104 --> 03:01:07,230
came at a steep price.

1232
03:01:28,419 --> 03:01:31,087
How are you? Tired?

1233
03:01:33,007 --> 03:01:36,926
Poor man.
You've lost a lot of weight.

1234
03:01:41,098 --> 03:01:43,641
I'll go throw
some water on my face.

1235
03:01:54,236 --> 03:01:56,946
Next time they come,
we fight to the finish.

1236
03:01:57,114 --> 03:02:01,367
It's better we fight it out
before we're spent.

1237
03:02:01,619 --> 03:02:05,163
When do you think
they'll attack?

1238
03:02:06,582 --> 03:02:09,584
They're exhausted too,
and a few are wounded.

1239
03:02:10,002 --> 03:02:12,128
They won't come tonight.

1240
03:02:12,296 --> 03:02:17,509
But they have no food,
and their ranks are splitting.

1241
03:02:18,427 --> 03:02:20,512
They can't afford
to dawdle either.

1242
03:02:20,763 --> 03:02:26,935
I say they'll come at us like hell
tomorrow morning.

1243
03:02:28,312 --> 03:02:29,979
Katsushiro.

1244
03:02:49,458 --> 03:02:50,959
An order from above.

1245
03:02:51,127 --> 03:02:54,295
Place two on watch
and let the rest sleep.

1246
03:02:55,005 --> 03:02:59,008
The men may visit their families
one at a time.

1247
03:03:00,803 --> 03:03:02,345
So tomorrow's the showdown?

1248
03:03:04,348 --> 03:03:06,558
Yes.
Please carry out the order.

1249
03:03:13,274 --> 03:03:17,068
You all heard what he just said.

1250
03:03:21,073 --> 03:03:23,491
I'll stand guard.

1251
03:03:24,118 --> 03:03:25,994
The rest of you sleep.

1252
03:03:27,037 --> 03:03:30,206
Manzo...

1253
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,042
you go home first.

1254
03:03:33,460 --> 03:03:35,879
Take a good look
at your daughter -

1255
03:03:36,672 --> 03:03:38,923
I mean, your son.

1256
03:03:47,933 --> 03:03:49,225
I told them.

1257
03:03:49,393 --> 03:03:51,561
All right. Get some rest.

1258
03:03:55,608 --> 03:03:57,942
Katsushiro.

1259
03:03:58,903 --> 03:04:00,445
How was Kikuchiyo?

1260
03:04:00,613 --> 03:04:03,698
Still beside the grave.

1261
03:04:03,949 --> 03:04:05,241
I see.

1262
03:05:18,565 --> 03:05:21,401
Are we all going
to die tomorrow?

1263
03:05:21,568 --> 03:05:24,654
There's no way to know.

1264
03:05:25,281 --> 03:05:27,824
But we might!

1265
03:05:50,055 --> 03:05:51,472
Shino.

1266
03:05:52,099 --> 03:05:53,766
Where's Shino?

1267
03:05:59,440 --> 03:06:01,024
Anyone seen Shino?

1268
03:06:35,476 --> 03:06:38,061
Sake, eh?
Where'd you find it?

1269
03:06:53,369 --> 03:06:56,412
I see. They have stockpiles,
just like Kikuchiyo said,

1270
03:06:56,580 --> 03:06:58,581
and tonight it all comes out.

1271
03:07:07,966 --> 03:07:10,593
I think I'll help myself.

1272
03:07:14,306 --> 03:07:15,890
Shino!

1273
03:07:41,667 --> 03:07:44,752
Here's some sake.
Drink up and get some sleep.

1274
03:07:50,008 --> 03:07:54,303
This is hardly like you.
You must rest for the battle tomorrow.

1275
03:08:05,858 --> 03:08:07,942
Shino!

1276
03:09:13,091 --> 03:09:14,967
<i>You tramp!</i>

1277
03:09:24,436 --> 03:09:27,522
You wench!

1278
03:09:31,401 --> 03:09:33,569
Stop this brutality!

1279
03:09:33,737 --> 03:09:38,074
What the hell's a farmer girl
doing with a samurai?

1280
03:10:03,517 --> 03:10:05,184
You slut!

1281
03:10:15,320 --> 03:10:16,904
Manzo.

1282
03:10:17,781 --> 03:10:20,283
Is this your daughter?

1283
03:10:26,748 --> 03:10:28,624
Tell me what happened.

1284
03:10:28,792 --> 03:10:33,129
You mentioned a samurai.
Who was it?

1285
03:10:34,715 --> 03:10:36,257
Manzo!

1286
03:10:45,976 --> 03:10:47,810
Manzo, say something.

1287
03:10:48,895 --> 03:10:50,479
Speak!

1288
03:11:22,846 --> 03:11:25,014
Are you Shino?

1289
03:11:44,242 --> 03:11:47,453
Manzo, don't be angry.

1290
03:11:48,914 --> 03:11:51,999
When the dawn threatens
our very lives,

1291
03:11:52,167 --> 03:11:55,503
the weight of it
makes us all a little reckless.

1292
03:12:01,343 --> 03:12:03,886
On the eve of decisive battles...

1293
03:12:05,430 --> 03:12:08,182
this often happens,
even inside castles.

1294
03:12:11,061 --> 03:12:15,106
Remember what it was to be young.
You can't blame them.

1295
03:12:16,066 --> 03:12:18,150
I can't forgive them.

1296
03:12:18,402 --> 03:12:21,570
I can't stand by when my only daughter
has been made damaged goods.

1297
03:12:36,128 --> 03:12:40,756
What's wrong with two people in love?
It's not like bandits took her!

1298
03:14:13,183 --> 03:14:17,436
They're wound up tight.
We need to loosen them up.

1299
03:14:25,529 --> 03:14:28,781
Everyone, the final battle
is here at last.

1300
03:14:31,785 --> 03:14:36,038
By the way, Katsushiro,
we expect much of you today.

1301
03:14:37,791 --> 03:14:40,876
As of last night,
you became a real man.

1302
03:14:58,895 --> 03:15:00,437
Hey!

1303
03:15:03,400 --> 03:15:06,527
Where's that fighting spirit?

1304
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:11,866
You'll never win
with such long faces!

1305
03:15:25,422 --> 03:15:27,590
Kikuchiyo, what are you up to?

1306
03:15:27,757 --> 03:15:30,092
I can't kill five
with just one blade.

1307
03:15:45,775 --> 03:15:47,693
There are 13 left.

1308
03:15:48,862 --> 03:15:52,823
We'll let them all in.

1309
03:15:54,409 --> 03:15:56,827
Once they pass this point,

1310
03:15:57,329 --> 03:16:01,206
we close in from all sides
at the crossing.

1311
03:16:04,127 --> 03:16:08,255
Everything's riding
on this battle!

1312
03:16:38,536 --> 03:16:40,788
Here they come!

1313
03:17:04,104 --> 03:17:06,355
Here they come!

1314
03:17:30,797 --> 03:17:33,007
Shichiroji and Katsushiro,
go west!

1315
03:17:33,258 --> 03:17:35,551
Kyuzo, Kikuchiyo, east!

1316
03:19:17,028 --> 03:19:19,988
Katsushiro! Rikichi!

1317
03:19:20,156 --> 03:19:22,825
East! Go east!

1318
03:19:22,992 --> 03:19:24,868
East!

1319
03:19:41,928 --> 03:19:43,720
Shut up!

1320
03:19:44,180 --> 03:19:46,390
Scream and you're dead!

1321
03:20:33,771 --> 03:20:34,980
We did it!

1322
03:20:35,148 --> 03:20:36,481
We did it!

1323
03:20:36,649 --> 03:20:39,401
Head east!

1324
03:20:54,751 --> 03:20:57,127
Katsushiro, pull back!

1325
03:20:59,631 --> 03:21:01,882
Damn you!

1326
03:21:03,593 --> 03:21:05,052
Kikuchiyo!

1327
03:21:41,214 --> 03:21:43,340
Kikuchiyo!

1328
03:21:53,726 --> 03:21:56,812
Where are the bandits?

1329
03:21:56,980 --> 03:21:58,981
They're all dead!

1330
03:22:17,292 --> 03:22:20,127
Once more we survive.

1331
03:25:58,304 --> 03:26:02,015
In the end,
we lost this battle too.

1332
03:26:02,892 --> 03:26:04,142
What?

1333
03:26:04,977 --> 03:26:06,603
I mean,

1334
03:26:06,979 --> 03:26:09,564
the victory belongs to those peasants.

1335
03:26:10,858 --> 03:26:12,692
Not to us.

1336
03:26:41,931 --> 03:26:46,810
THE END
