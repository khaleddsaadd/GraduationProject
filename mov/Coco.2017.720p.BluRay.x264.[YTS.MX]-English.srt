stealing the guitar.

Guitar?

518
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,950
It was my

wanted me to have it.

of that musician.

01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:45,980
(GASPS) Miguel,
you must come to the show!

1182
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,010
You will be
my guest of honor!

1183
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,430
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

1184
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,290
(SIGHING) I can't.

1185
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,990
I have to get home
before sunrise.

1186
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,310
Oh! I really do
need to get you home.

1187
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,160
It has been an honor.

1188
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:08,570
I am sorry
to see you go, Miguel.

1189
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,450
I hope you die very soon.

1190
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,660
(CHUCKLES)
You know what I mean.

1191
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,480
Miguel, I give you my bless...

1192
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,550
HECTOR:
We had a deal, <i>chamaco.</i>

1193
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:25,180
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

1194
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,020
Oh, Frida! I thought
you couldn't make it.

1195
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,190
You said
you'd take back my photo.

1196
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,590
You promised, Miguel.

1197
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,630
You know this, uh, man?

1198
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:37,380
Uh, I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

1199
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,630
(STAMMERS) Hector?

1200
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:42,920
Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.

1201
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,080
My friend,
you're being forgotten.

1202
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,710
- And whose fault is that?
- Hector, please...

1203
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:53,510
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

1204
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,580
What?

1205
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,210
If I'm being forgotten,
it's because you never

1206
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,090
told anyone
that I wrote them!

1207
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,320
That's crazy! De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.

1208
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,220
You want to tell him
or should I?

1209
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,630
Hector, I never meant
to take credit.

1210
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:09,200
We made a great team,
but you died...

1211
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,230
and I only sang your songs

1212
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,230
because I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.

1213
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,970
Oh, how generous!

1214
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:18,200
You really did
play together.

1215
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,540
I don't want
to fight about it.

1216
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,380
I just want you
to make it right.

1217
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,430
Miguel can put my photo up, and
I can cross over the bridge.

1218
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,150
I can see my girl.

1219
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:32,120
Ernesto,
remember the night I left?

1220
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,650
That was a long time ago.

1221
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,290
We drank together
and you told me

1222
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:37,260
you would move
Heaven and Earth...

1223
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:41,230
for your <i>amigo.</i>
Well, I'm asking you to now.

1224
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:43,530
Heaven and Earth?
Like in the movie?

1225
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:46,270
- What?
- That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1226
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:48,770
In the de la Cruz movie,
<i>El Camino a Casa.</i>

1227
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:50,170
I'm talking about
my real life, Miguel.

1228
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:53,010
No! It's in there. Look!

1229
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,380
DON: (ON TV) <i>Never were
truer words spoken.</i>

1230
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,540
<i>This calls for a toast.
To our friendship!</i> (LAUGHS)

1231
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:00,250
<i>I would move Heaven and Earth
for you,</i> mi amigo.

1232
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,380
But in the movie, Don
Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1233
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:06,340
- DON: Salud!
- DE LA CRUZ: <i>Poison!</i>

1234
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:12,790
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left...

1235
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,400
<i>We'd been performing
on the road for months.</i>

1236
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,700
<i>I got homesick...</i>

1237
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,480
<i>and I packed up my songs.</i>

1238
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:20,070
You want to give up now

1239
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,540
when we're this close
to reaching our dream?

1240
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,570
This was your dream.
You'll manage.

1241
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,570
I can't do this
without your songs, Hector.

1242
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,740
I'm going home, Ernesto.

1243
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,490
Hate me if you want,
but my mind is made up.

1244
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,550
(DOOR OPENS)

1245
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,820
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go,

1246
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,930
then I'm sending you off
with a toast.

1247
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:44,760
To our friendship.

1248
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,380
I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, <i>mi amigo. Salud!</i>

1249
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,470
HECTOR: <i>You walked me
to the train station.</i>

1250
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,340
<i>But I felt
a pain in my stomach.</i>

1251
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,610
<i>I thought it must have been
something I ate.</i>

1252
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:03,110
Perhaps it was
that <i>chorizo,</i> my friend.

1253
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,660
HECTOR:
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

1254
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,930
<i>I woke up dead.</i>

1255
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,790
You poisoned me.

1256
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:18,320
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hector.

1257
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:21,980
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.

1258
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:27,080
HECTOR: <i>I never thought that
you might have... That you...</i>

1259
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:30,870
- (YELLS)
- (GROANS)

1260
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,740
- How could you?
- Hector!

1261
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,090
Security! Security!

1262
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:38,830
You took everything
away from me! You rat!

1263
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:43,350
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.

1264
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:48,140
I just wanted to go back home.
No! No!

1265
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,630
(PANTING) I apologize.
Where were we?

1266
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:54,830
You were going to give me
your blessing.

1267
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:57,480
Yes. Uh, <i>si.</i>

1268
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,240
Miguel, uh,
my reputation...

1269
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,710
(CHUCKLES) It is
very important to me.

1270
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,810
I would hate
to have you think...

1271
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:13,850
That you murdered Hector
for his songs?

1272
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,280
(LAUGHS)

1273
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,580
You don't think that.
Do you?

1274
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:23,570
(STAMMERS) I... No. Everyone
knows you're the good guy.

1275
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,880
<i>Papa</i> Ernesto, my blessing?

1276
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:39,610
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

1277
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:42,740
What? But I'm your family!

1278
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,310
And Hector
was my best friend.

1279
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:48,710
Success doesn't
come for free, Miguel.

1280
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,880
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes

1281
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:54,350
- to seize your moment.
- (GASPS)

1282
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,940
I know you understand.

1283
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,870
No! No!

1284
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:00,560
(GRUNTING)

1285
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,500
Let go! No!

1286
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,510
(SCREAMING)

1287
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,690
(GASPS AND COUGHS)

1288
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,260
(ECHOING) Help!
Can anyone hear me?

1289
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,710
I want to go home.

1290
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,510
(PANTING)

1291
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:49,120
- (RUSTLING)
- (GASPS)

1292
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,910
- (STAMMERS) Hector?
- Kid?

1293
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,780
Oh, Hector!
You were right.

1294
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:58,380
I should have gone
back to my family.

1295
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:00,950
They told me not
to be like de la Cruz,

1296
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,790
but I didn't listen.

1297
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,790
I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.

1298
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:09,360
I didn't care if I was
on their stupid <i>ofrenda.</i>

1299
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,270
Hey, <i>chamaco.</i>
It's okay. It's okay.

1300
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:14,880
I told them I didn't care.

1301
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,570
(GASPING)

1302
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:21,760
Hector! Hector?

1303
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,680
She's forgetting me.

1304
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,960
- Who?
- My daughter.

1305
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:35,820
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.

1306
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:39,330
I just wanted
to see her again.

1307
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:42,010
I never should have
left Santa Cecilia.

1308
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,060
I wish I could apologize.

1309
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:49,070
I wish I could tell her that her
<i>papa</i> was trying to come home.

1310
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:51,650
That he loved her so much.

1311
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,890
My Coco...

1312
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,630
Coco?

1313
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,830
Where did you get this?

1314
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:22,650
That's my <i>Mama</i> Coco.
That's my <i>Mama</i> Imelda.

1315
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,690
Is that you?

1316
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:33,830
- We're...
- BOTH: Family?

1317
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:48,730
HECTOR: I always hoped
I'd see her again.

1318
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:51,130
That she'd miss me.

1319
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:55,220
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

1320
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,500
You know the worst part?

1321
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,770
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...

1322
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:04,380
I thought at least
one day I'd see her here.

1323
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,090
Give her the biggest hug.

1324
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:11,880
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

1325
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:14,150
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

1326
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:18,060
You disappear...
from this one.

1327
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,930
You'll never get to see her.

1328
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:21,940
Ever again.

1329
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:28,070
You know,
I wrote her a song once.

1330
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:32,070
We used to sing it every
night at the same time.

1331
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,820
No matter
how far apart we were.

1332
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,440
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her

1333
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:41,400
one... last... time.

1334
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:47,120
<i>♪ Remember me</i>

1335
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,970

He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.

01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:56,250
