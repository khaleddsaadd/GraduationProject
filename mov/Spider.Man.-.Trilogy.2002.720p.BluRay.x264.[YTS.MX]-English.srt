1
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,274
Who am l?
You sure you wanna know?

2
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,735
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.

3
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,530
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...

4
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,201
...if somebody told you I was just your
average guy, not a care in the world...

5
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,161
...somebody lied.

6
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,624
But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...

7
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,209
...is all about a girl.

8
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:35,548
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.

9
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,801
The woman I've loved
since before I even liked girls.

10
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,637
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.

11
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,806
Aw, heck, l'd even take him.

12
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,727
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,896
That's me.

14
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,981
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,399
Stop!

16
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,818
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,071
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

18
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,489
Catch a cab, Parker!

19
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,747
Thank you. l'm sorry l'm late.

20
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,462
What a geek!

21
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,342
-Don't even think about it.
-You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,093
Would you date him?

23
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,197
Midtown High seniors.

24
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,076
No wandering. Proceed direct--
Knock it off.

25
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,829
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

26
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,458
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

27
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,877
So behave accordingly.

28
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,089
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

29
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,924
Come on, people, stay together.

30
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:03,010
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

31
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,223
-Where were you?
-Checking out the library.

32
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,934
-Looking at the books.
-Yeah, right.

33
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,063
Charles, can we drive
around the corner, please?

34
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,523
Why?

35
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,525
The entrance is right there.

36
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,404
Dad, these are public-school kids.
I'm not showing up in the Rolls.

37
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,906
What, you want me
to trade in my car for a Jetta...

38
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,076
...because you flunked out
of every private school I sent you to?

39
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,246
-It wasn't for me.
-Of course it was.

40
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,581
Don't ever be ashamed
of who you are.

41
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,251
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

42
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,752
It's just....

43
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,379
Just what, Harry?

44
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,089
Forget it.

45
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,427
Pete!

46
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,512
-Hi, Harry.
-Hey, man. What's up?

47
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,055
Harry.

48
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,433
-Won't you be needing this?
-Thanks, Dad.

49
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,769
Peter, may I introduce my father,
Norman Osborn.

50
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,354
I've heard so much about you.

51
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:59,025
-Great honour to meet you, sir.
-Harry says you're a science whiz.

52
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,111
You know,
I'm something of a scientist myself.

53
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,448
I read all your research
on nanotechnology. Really brilliant.

54
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,659
-And you understood it?
-Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

55
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,121
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

56
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,123
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are.

57
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,876
Hey, you two! Let's move!

58
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,713
-Nice to meet you.
-Hope to see you again.

59
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,552
-He doesn't seem so bad.
-Not if you're a genius.

60
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,679
I think he wants to adopt you.

61
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:33,559
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

62
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,563
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.

63
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:38,856
That's amazing!

64
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,943
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.

65
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,321
It's unreal.

66
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,282
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

67
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,744
...varying strengths to help them
search for food.

68
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:56,415
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...

69
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,753
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

70
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,671
For the school paper?

71
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:12,181
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...

72
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,266
...genus Kukulcania.

73
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:18,854
Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

74
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:24,318
...proportionately equal to the
high-tension wires used in bridges.

75
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,445
-Leave him alone.
-Or what?

76
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,615
Or his father will fire your father.

77
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,368
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

78
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,037
What is going on?

79
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,290
The next person who talks
will fail this course. I kid you not.

80
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,501
-This spider...
-Let's go.

81
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,839
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

82
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,551
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

83
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,886
-An early awareness of danger.
-Jerks.

84
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,847
A spider-sense.

85
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,141
Hey, look at that spider.

86
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,728
Some spiders change colours
to blend into their environment.

87
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,897
It's a defence mechanism.

88
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,359
Peter, what makes you think
I would want to know that?

89
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,735
Who wouldn't?

90
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,739
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility....

91
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,286
-You gonna talk to her now?
-Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

92
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,413
Armed with these DNA blueprints...

93
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,249
...we have now begun
what was once thought impossible.

94
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,128
-Disgusting.
-Yeah, hateful little things.

95
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,713
I love them!

96
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,923
Yeah, me too.

97
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:32,761
You know, spiders can change
their colour...

98
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,765
-...to blend into their environment.
-Really?

99
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:41,145
-Yeah, it's a defence mechanism.
-Cool.

100
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,648
--transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

101
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,943
...combining the genetic
information from all three spiders...

102
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,781
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

103
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,450
There's 14.

104
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,285
I beg your pardon?

105
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,996
-One's missing.
-Yeah.

106
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,543
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

107
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,380
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope...

108
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,798
...on the Eastern Seaboard?

109
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,011
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

110
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,930
Let's go talk about how we listen.

111
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:24,104
Now, I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

112
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,190
...but at Midtown High....

113
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,410
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

114
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,162
-Sure.
-Great.

115
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,539
Where do you want me?
Over here?

116
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,083
Yeah, that's great.

117
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,168
Don't make me look ugly.

118
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,379
That's impossible.

119
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,887
Perfect.

120
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,188
-Is that good?
-Great.

121
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,112
That's great.

122
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,703
M.J., let's go!

123
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,832
Wait. Thanks!

124
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,056
Parker, let's do it.

125
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,243
We solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

126
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,954
I've already seen the glider.

127
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,415
That's not what I'm here for.

128
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,293
General Slocum,
good to see you again.

129
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,296
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

130
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,381
-Norman.
-Mr. Osborn.

131
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,093
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

132
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,722
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

133
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,393
We tried vapour inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

134
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,437
-Excellent.
-Any side effects?

135
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,688
In one trial, yes.

136
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,524
An aberration. All the tests since
have been successful.

137
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,445
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

138
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,947
Violence, aggression...

139
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,866
...and insanity.

140
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,786
-What do you recommend?
-That was only one test.

141
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,873
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our entire staff certifies the product...

142
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,959
-...ready for human testing.
-Dr. Stromm?

143
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,964
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

144
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,635
-Back to formula?
-Dr. Osborn.

145
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,638
I'll be frank with you.

146
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,726
I never supported your programme. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

147
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,646
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

148
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,732
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

149
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,653
-They test in two weeks.
-And if your performance enhancers...

150
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:22,241
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

151
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,870
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

152
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,332
Gentlemen. Ladies.

153
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:40,843
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilà! There is light.

154
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,178
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

155
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:48,183
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

156
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,936
I'm already on my ass, May.

157
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:55,607
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

158
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,485
...what else would you call it?
I am on my ass.

159
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,029
Hand me that dish. The green one.

160
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,032
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

161
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,368
...and upsizing their profits.

162
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,538
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

163
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,459
Well.... Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

164
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,379
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

165
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,173
Computer....

166
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,135
Computer salesman, computer
engineer, computer analyst.

167
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,055
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

168
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:32,644
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

169
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,731
I love you. And Peter loves you.

170
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,234
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

171
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:43,906
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

172
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,328
Hi, sweetie. You're just--
Just in time for dinner.

173
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,080
Hey. How you doing, buddy?
How was the field trip?

174
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,083
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

175
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,753
-You won't have a bite?
-No thanks. Had a bite.

176
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,339
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

177
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,009
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

178
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,012
What's that all about?

179
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,494
In this recombination lab...

180
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:35,290
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

181
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,544
...combining the genetic
information from all three spiders...

182
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:43,549
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

183
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,984
Dr. Osborn, please. The
performance enhancers aren't ready.

184
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,487
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

185
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,324
Now, l'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

186
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,702
Don't be a coward.

187
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,746
Risks are part of laboratory science.

188
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,667
Let me reschedule, with a proper
medical staff and a volunteer.

189
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,337
-Just give me two weeks.
-Two weeks? ln two weeks...

190
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,008
...we'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

191
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,927
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

192
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,763
-Get me the Promachloraperazine.
-For what?

193
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,684
It begins catalyzation when the vapour
hits the bloodstream.

194
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,272
40,000 years of evolution...

195
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,192
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

196
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,374
Oh, that's cold.

197
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,101
Norman?

198
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,442
Norman!

199
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,952
Oh, my God.

200
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,581
Oh, my God! Norman?

201
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,376
Oh, my God! Norman!

202
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,977
Back to formula?

203
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,513
Weird.

204
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,817
-Peter?
-Yeah?

205
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,778
Are you all right?

206
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,323
I'm fine.

207
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,742
Any better this morning?
Any change?

208
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,285
Change?

209
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,205
Yep. Big change.

210
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,375
-Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
-Right.

211
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,145
Okay.

212
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:15,654
-Goodness me!
-Jeez. I thought you were sick.

213
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,531
-I got better.
-You see?

214
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,076
-Bye, guys.
-Have you got your lunch money?

215
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,913
Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget,
we're painting the kitchen after school.

216
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,874
Sure thing, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

217
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,168
And don't start up with me.

218
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:35,423
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

219
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,095
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

220
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,849
-I have to go to school.
-Who's stopping you?

221
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,909
Hi, M.J.

222
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,287
Hey, M.J.

223
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:10,083
I don't know if you realise this, but
we've been neighbours since I was 6.

224
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,587
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

225
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,338
I got the car. Hop in.

226
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,133
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

227
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:21,052
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

228
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,680
Or not.

229
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,855
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

230
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,942
-Stop the bus!
-Catch a cab!

231
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,986
Tell him to stop.

232
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,655
-Check him out!
-Dork!

233
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,387
Dad!

234
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,723
Dad, are you all right?

235
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,850
Harry.

236
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,189
What are you doing on the floor?

237
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,690
I don't know.

238
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,860
Have you been there all night?

239
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,113
Last night I was--

240
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,700
What?

241
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,703
-I don't remember.
-Mr. Osborn?

242
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,247
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.

243
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:35,794
-My father's not feeling well.
-Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

244
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:36,962
What?

245
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,715
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

246
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,177
-What are you talking about?
-And the flight suit and the glider....

247
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,429
-What about it?
-It's been stolen, sir.

248
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,124
Wow! Great reflexes!

249
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,168
-Thanks.
-No problem.

250
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,173
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

251
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,592
You just get contacts?

252
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,518
Well, see you.

253
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,813
-What happened?
-He's freaking weird.

254
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,648
Did you see that?

255
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,902
Parker?

256
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,103
-It's a fight!
-Think you're pretty funny, freak?

257
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,314
-Flash, it was an accident.
-So is my breaking your teeth.

258
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,192
-Come on, Flash, stop.
-I don't wanna fight you, Flash.

259
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,820
-I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.
-Kick his ass.

260
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,091
Help him, Harry.

261
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,556
How'd he do that?

262
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:36,891
Which one?

263
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,434
He's all yours, man.

264
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,660
Flash, get up!

265
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,415
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

266
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,835
Peter, that was-- That was amazing.

267
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,754
I'm out of here. Come on.

268
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:52,986
Go, web!

269
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,197
Fly.

270
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,867
Up, up and away, web.

271
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,870
Shazam!

272
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,706
Go! Go!

273
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,708
Go, web, go!

274
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,576
Tallyho.

275
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:28,122
-Is she back with the beer yet?
-What?

276
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,540
Bring me some beer.

277
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,293
-Get up off your ass.
-I paid for beer--

278
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,961
-Stop yelling.
-Stop it!

279
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,464
You're as stupid as your mother.
Get away from me!

280
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,216
You are drunk, do you know that?

281
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,927
Where's she going?
Where you going?

282
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,348
These dishes are not done.
Somebody's gotta do the dishes.

283
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,851
-Why don't you do them?
-Get in here and do the dishes.

284
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,189
-You do them. They're yours, anyway.
-I'm going out!

285
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,900
-Were you listening to that?
-No.

286
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,487
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

287
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,407
I guess you can always hear us.

288
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,867
Everybody shouts.

289
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,327
Your aunt and uncle don't.

290
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,289
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

291
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,878
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash--

292
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,755
You really freaked us out.

293
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,216
I'm sorry. ls he okay?

294
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,470
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

295
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,768
So where are you going
after you graduate?

296
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,817
I wanna move into the city.

297
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:43,531
And hopefully get a job
as a photographer.

298
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,534
Work my way through college.

299
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,870
What about you?

300
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,038
Headed for the city too.

301
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,000
Can't wait to get out of here.

302
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,669
I wanna....

303
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,422
What?

304
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,427
No, come on. Try me.

305
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,929
I wanna...

306
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,390
...act...

307
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,059
...on-stage.

308
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,395
Really?

309
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,939
Oh, that's perfect.

310
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,775
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

311
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,944
-Really?
-Yeah.

312
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,615
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

313
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,284
Peter, that was first grade.

314
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,286
Well...

315
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,330
...even so.

316
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,249
Sometimes...

317
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,752
...you know people.

318
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,507
You can just see what's coming.

319
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,346
What do you see coming for you?

320
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,600
I don't know.

321
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:59,607
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

322
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,113
And what for me?

323
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,615
For you?

324
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,786
You're gonna light up Broadway.

325
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,622
You know...

326
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,629
...you're taller than you look.

327
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,339
I hunch.

328
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,093
Don't.

329
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,308
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

330
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,561
Come on.

331
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,980
I gotta go.

332
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,982
Bye.

333
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,318
-Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
-Yeah, right?

334
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,487
-Look at it!
-Hop in.

335
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,906
Oh, my God! What a cool car!

336
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,741
Pretty tight, huh?

337
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,496
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

338
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,499
Cool car.

339
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,260
What's going on in there?

340
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,097
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

341
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,934
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

342
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,311
Okay. Thanks.

343
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,470
Something's bothering him. Maybe
he's too embarrassed to tell me.

344
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,306
Maybe I'm too embarrassed
to ask him.

345
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,143
I just don't know anymore.

346
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,895
I'm going to the library.
I'll see you later.

347
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,691
-Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.
-I'll take the train.

348
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,111
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

349
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:46,625
-Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
-Wait a minute, we need to talk.

350
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:51,172
-We can talk later.
-Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

351
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,258
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

352
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,302
Because we haven't talked
for so long...

353
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,471
...May and I
don't know who you are anymore.

354
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:03,684
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

355
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:07,980
-You start fights at school--
-I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

356
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,150
-You sure as hell finished it.
-Was I supposed to run away?

357
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,361
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but....

358
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:19,074
Pete, you're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

359
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,826
No. Not exactly.

360
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,119
Peter...

361
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,372
...these are the years
when a man changes...

362
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,543
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

363
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,004
Just be careful
who you change into.

364
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:38,844
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

365
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,097
But just because you can
beat him up...

366
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,809
...doesn't give you the right to.

367
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:50,731
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

368
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:56,320
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

369
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,907
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing me.

370
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,411
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know l'm not your father--

371
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,414
Then stop pretending to be!

372
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,753
Right.

373
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,675
I'll pick you up here at 10.

374
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,753
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

375
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,512
-One, two, three. That's it!
-Who's the man?

376
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,852
Ladies and gentlemen...

377
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,565
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

378
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,322
For $3000...

379
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,117
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

380
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:29,997
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

381
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,668
Who?

382
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,795
I know who.

383
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:41,800
The Flying Dutchman!

384
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,594
Next.

385
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,723
There's no featherweight
division here, small fry. Next.

386
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,725
No, no. Sign me up.

387
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,562
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

388
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,858
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?

389
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,277
And you're participating
under your own free will?

390
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,528
Yes.

391
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,491
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

392
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,329
Told you! Told you!

393
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,331
Winner!

394
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,749
Next victim!

395
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,504
Are you ready for more?

396
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,217
Bone Saw is ready!

397
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:30,307
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

398
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:35,229
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

399
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,858
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to--

400
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,737
-What's your name, kid?
-The Human Spider.

401
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,699
That's it? That's the best you got?

402
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,993
-Yeah.
-Oh, that sucks.

403
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,664
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

404
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,084
...the terrifying, the deadly...

405
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,546
...the amazing Spider-Man!

406
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,551
-It's "The Human Spider."
-I don't care, get out there.

407
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,762
-No, he got my name wrong.
-Get out there, you moron.

408
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,809
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

409
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,061
I hope you brought your mommy.

410
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,773
-We'll break you!
-You'll need someone to cry to.

411
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:26,196
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

412
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,741
Oh, my God!

413
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,576
Oh, my legs!

414
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,370
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

415
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:45,299
Kill! Kill! Kill!

416
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,675
Cage!

417
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,478
Hello? Guys?

418
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:03,484
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

419
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:08,489
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

420
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,159
Unlock the thing!
Take the chain off!

421
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,161
Hey, freak show!

422
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,997
You're going nowhere.

423
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,541
I got you for three minutes.

424
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,002
Three minutes of playtime.

425
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,428
-What are you doing up there?
-Staying away from you.

426
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,890
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

427
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,565
Finish him off!

428
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,282
Smash him!

429
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,208
-Hit him!
-Harder!

430
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,546
Kick his spider ass!

431
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:08,715
Hit him!

432
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,939
One, two, three!

433
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,942
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

434
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,197
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!

435
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,743
Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
Spider-Man!

436
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,258
Now get out of here.

437
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,721
A hundred bucks?
The ad said 3000.

438
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,307
Well, check it again, webhead.

439
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:02,352
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

440
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,939
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

441
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,482
I need that money.

442
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,028
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

443
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,456
-Hey, what the hell--?
-Put the money in the bag.

444
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,626
Hurry up!

445
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,051
Hey! He stole the gate!

446
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,178
Stop that guy!

447
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,014
Stop him! He's got my money!

448
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,474
Thanks.

449
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,144
What's the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

450
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,521
Cut him off in the lobby
and call the cops!

451
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,734
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away with my money.

452
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,153
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

453
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,592
-Sir, you gotta get back.
-I can't see. What happened?

454
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,220
Old dude, man.

455
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,599
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

456
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,602
-What happened?
-Someone got hurt.

457
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:31,191
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Stay back.

458
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,527
-Stay back!
-That's my uncle!

459
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,407
-What happened?
-Carjacker. He's been shot.

460
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,994
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

461
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,578
Uncle Ben?

462
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,998
Uncle Ben.

463
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,086
Uncle Ben?

464
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:56,216
Peter.

465
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,885
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

466
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:05,726
Peter.

467
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,751
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

468
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,672
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

469
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,789
Get a unit to the rear!

470
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,294
I got the back!

471
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:33,600
Who's there?

472
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,963
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

473
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,634
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

474
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,302
Answer me!

475
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,974
Stop that guy!

476
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,147
Thanks.

477
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,158
See you.

478
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:57,309
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.

479
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,395
Oh, no. My God.

480
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:48,068
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

481
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,371
-Good evening.
-General. Good to see you.

482
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,041
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

483
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:08,380
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

484
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,884
-He's clear, let's go!
-You're confident about this test?

485
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,345
Absolutely.
Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

486
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,848
Now, what about your commitment
to OSCORP?

487
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,936
Nothing would please me more than to
put Norman Osborn out of business.

488
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,316
Preflight complete. Mark.

489
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,073
We are picking up
an unidentified object, closing fast.

490
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,324
What the hell is that?

491
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:37,992
Can you see anything?

492
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,828
Oh, my God!

493
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,966
-Say "chess."
-Chess!

494
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,343
Peter!

495
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:59,472
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

496
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,727
Pete? Good news. Dad got the place
in New York, so we're all set this fall.

497
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,478
-That's great.
-You made it.

498
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,568
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

499
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,155
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Dad.

500
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,199
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

501
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,868
Yeah.

502
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,207
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

503
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,627
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

504
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,379
Commencement:

505
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:35,675
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

506
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:41,181
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

507
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,933
You know what? Whatever.

508
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:45,935
Your loss.

509
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,190
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

510
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,318
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.

511
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,335
Can I fix you something?

512
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:12,003
No, thanks.

513
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,967
I missed him a lot today.

514
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,054
I know.

515
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,641
I miss him too.

516
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,728
But he was there.

517
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:19,112
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

518
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:24,325
He tried to tell me something
important, and I threw it in his face.

519
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,162
You loved him...

520
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,083
...and he loved you.

521
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,629
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

522
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:40,258
How you were meant
for great things.

523
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,136
You won't disappoint him.

524
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,840
With great power
comes great responsibility.

525
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,218
Remember that, Pete.
Remember that.

526
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,521
Hurry up!

527
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:51,621
He's not a man. My brother saw him
building a nest in Lincoln Center.

528
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,999
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

529
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:01,839
Bobby. Get a load of this!

530
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:07,053
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out...

531
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,263
...and he climbs up them
like a spider web.

532
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:13,685
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider-Man was here.

533
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,479
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

534
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,399
Some kind of freakyloo
or something. Wackadoo.

535
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,567
He stinks and I don't like him.

536
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,903
Don't move, lady!

537
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,747
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

538
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,083
He has those tights
and that tight little--

539
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,586
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug

540
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:44,549
But we should all just give him
One big hug

541
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:49,345
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

542
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:56,769
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

543
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:00,815
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

544
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,942
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs--

545
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,527
There's a page six problem.

546
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,612
We have a page one problem.
Shut up.

547
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,322
-Well?
-He's news.

548
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,950
-The clients can't wait.
-They're about to.

549
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:15,204
-He pulled six people off a subway.
-From a wreck he probably caused.

550
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,040
Something goes wrong
and he's there.

551
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,542
Look! He's fleeing the scene.
What's that tell you?

552
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,462
He's not fleeing, he's probably
going to save somebody else.

553
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,629
He's a hero!

554
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,632
Then why does he wear a mask?
What's he got to hide?

555
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,761
She needs to know if you want
chintz or chenille in the dining room.

556
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,472
-Whichever one's cheaper.
-Mr. Jameson, it's like this:

557
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,973
We double-booked page six.

558
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,476
So Macy's and Conway's both have
three quarters--

559
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,812
-We sold out four printings.
-Sold out?

560
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,230
Every copy.

561
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,317
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,
with a decent picture.

562
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,152
-Conway to page 7.
-That's a problem.

563
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,654
Page eight, give him 10 percent off.
Five percent.

564
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,531
-That can't be done.
-Get out of here!

565
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,617
We don't have a decent picture.

566
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:55,536
Eddie's been on it for weeks,
but we can barely see him.

567
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,830
Aw, what is he, shy?

568
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:02,001
If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

569
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:05,588
Put an ad on the front page:
"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."

570
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,217
He doesn't wanna be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

571
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,521
Hey!

572
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,106
Buzz off.

573
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:26,776
-M.J., it's me, Peter.
-Hi!

574
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:33,366
-What are you doing around here?
-Begging for a job. How about you?

575
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,578
-I'm headed to an audition.
-An audition? So you're acting?

576
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:38,788
Yeah.

577
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:42,875
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

578
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,210
That's great.

579
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,005
-You're doing it. Living your dream.
-Glamour girl!

580
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,799
Your drawer was short $6!

581
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,593
Next time that happens,
I'll take it out of your cheque.

582
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,473
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

583
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,976
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

584
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:04,272
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

585
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,947
Some dream, huh?

586
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,450
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

587
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,412
-Don't tell Harry.
-Don't tell Harry?

588
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:24,417
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

589
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,419
Oh, yeah. Right.

590
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,755
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

591
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:34,343
-He'd think it was low or something.
-It's not low. You have a job.

592
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:39,015
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

593
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,435
No, I guess not.

594
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,025
Thanks, Pete.

595
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,361
We should catch up sometime.

596
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:59,118
Let's get some lunch some evening.

597
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,874
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

598
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,793
-And I won't tell Harry.
-No, don't tell Harry.

599
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,212
I won't.

600
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,132
I won't tell Harry.

601
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,896
Timing's perfect. Hey.

602
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:30,399
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

603
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,196
Storming Norman's
making his weekly inspection.

604
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,282
Spent half of it on the phone.

605
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:43,579
Look, man, l'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

606
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,706
Are you all right?

607
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:51,587
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

608
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,800
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

609
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,551
You were late again?

610
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,930
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

611
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,557
Around.

612
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,434
Peter Parker.

613
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,271
-Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
-Who's that?

614
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,524
-This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
-Dad.

615
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,567
-When do I get to meet her?
-Dad.

616
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,029
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

617
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:23,160
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

618
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,205
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

619
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:30,710
-No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
-It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.

620
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:35,172
No, I couldn't accept it, sir.
I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.

621
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,008
I respect that.

622
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:39,844
You want to make it
on your own steam.

623
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,846
That's great.

624
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,057
What other skills do you have,
Parker?

625
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,226
I was thinking about photography.

626
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,605
Hello.

627
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,818
Let's go! Move it!

628
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,654
Watch the street!

629
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,463
Cheese!

630
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,681
They're crap.

631
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,851
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

632
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:32,229
-I'll give you $200 for all of them.
-That seems a little low.

633
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,190
Take them somewhere else, then.

634
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:36,901
Your wife says the tile for the foyer
is out of stock.

635
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:38,694
Tell her we'll put a rug there.

636
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:41,030
Sit down. Give me that.

637
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,159
Give you 300.
That's the standard freelance fee.

638
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,661
-Tear up page one. Run that photo.
-Headline?

639
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:51,248
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."

640
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,250
Menace? He was protecting
that armoured--

641
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,460
Tell you what, Atticus.

642
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:57,338
You take the pictures,
I'll make up the headlines. Okay?

643
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:59,507
-Yes, sir.
-Goody.

644
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,469
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

645
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,722
-I'd like a job, sir.
-No jobs. Freelance.

646
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,557
Best thing for a kid your age.

647
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:13,062
You bring me more shots
of that clown, maybe I'll buy them.

648
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,232
But I never said you have a job.
Meat.

649
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,694
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.

650
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,489
-Hi.
-Hi.

651
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,118
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

652
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,330
-Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
-Thank you.

653
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,249
I'm Peter Parker.

654
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,920
I'm a photographer.

655
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,257
Yes. I can see that.

656
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,808
As of today...

657
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:54,979
...OSCORP lndustries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

658
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:59,650
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

659
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,653
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

660
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,990
...costs are down,
revenues are up...

661
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,076
...and our stock
has never been higher.

662
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:13,664
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

663
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,749
What?

664
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:21,130
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

665
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,091
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

666
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,426
Why wasn't I told?

667
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:29,680
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

668
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,266
The deal is off if you come with it.

669
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:35,853
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

670
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,022
You can't do this to me.

671
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,486
I started this company.

672
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,947
You know how much I sacrificed?!

673
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:56,248
-Oh, Max. Please.
-Norman, the board is unanimous.

674
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:00,794
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

675
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,463
I'm sorry.

676
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,591
You're out, Norman.

677
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:16,977
Am l?

678
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,109
Welcome to OSCORP lndustries
Unity Day Festival.

679
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,696
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

680
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,653
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

681
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:12,366
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

682
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:17,037
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think l'm pretty.

683
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,999
I think you're beautiful.

684
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:36,056
M.J., would you do me a favour?
I forgot my drink inside.

685
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,402
-Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
-Oh, Harry.

686
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:54,658
-Have you seen my father around?
-Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

687
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,173
-What is that?
-Must be new this year.

688
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,304
What is that?

689
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,555
That's our glider!

690
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,276
What the hell was that?

691
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,098
Code three!

692
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,282
-Oh, my God! Harry!
-M.J.!

693
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:26,709
Harry! Help me! Harry!

694
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,425
Out, am l?

695
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,056
-Mary Jane!
-Harry!

696
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,061
Hello, my dear.

697
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,897
It's Spider-Man!

698
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,369
-Come on, move, kid.
-Billy!

699
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:08,208
Somebody help him!

700
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,668
No!

701
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,005
Mommy!

702
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,967
-Hold it!
-I surrender.

703
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:20,053
-Oh, boy.
-Hold it right there!

704
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,102
Impressive.

705
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,838
-Mary Jane!
-Help! Someone please help me!

706
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,240
Hold on!

707
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:23,909
Watch out!

708
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:36,839
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

709
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,342
Hold on, Mary Jane!

710
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:25,012
Well, beats taking the subway.

711
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,432
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

712
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,766
Wait.

713
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,184
Who are you?

714
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,937
-You know who I am.
-I do?

715
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,148
Your friendly neighbourhood
Spider-Man.

716
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:52,372
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

717
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:57,210
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'm gonna come over.

718
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,546
No, I'm gonna come--

719
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:03,300
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

720
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,470
And we'll go and have breakfast
and...

721
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,931
...I wanna buy you something.

722
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,434
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

723
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:17,147
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

724
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,361
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

725
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,279
Don't let the bedbugs--

726
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,996
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

727
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,335
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

728
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,339
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

729
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,550
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

730
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,136
You're right.

731
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,555
I didn't.

732
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,979
I'm gonna get some rest.

733
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,482
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

734
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,318
What was that thing?

735
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,320
I don't know.

736
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:10,033
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

737
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,592
Somebody there?

738
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,886
Somebody.

739
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,764
Who said that?

740
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:36,768
Don't play the innocent with me.

741
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,898
You've known all along.

742
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,279
Where are you?

743
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:51,575
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

744
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,208
I'm right here.

745
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,962
I don't understand.

746
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:08,133
Did you think it was coincidence?

747
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,928
So many good things,
all happening for you.

748
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:15,766
All for you. Norman.

749
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,728
What do you want?

750
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,314
To say what you won't.

751
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:25,150
To do what you can't.

752
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,905
To remove those in your way.

753
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,827
The board members.

754
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,497
You killed them.

755
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,290
We killed them.

756
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,625
We?

757
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:43,335
Remember?

758
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:46,171
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

759
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,800
The performance enhancers.

760
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:55,013
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

761
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:59,309
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

762
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:02,354
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

763
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,023
And it's only the beginning.

764
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:10,862
There's only one who can stop us.

765
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:15,158
Or imagine if he joined us.

766
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,041
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

767
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,545
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

768
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,338
These weirdos
all gotta have a name.

769
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:29,714
Mr. Jameson, Spider--

770
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,550
-Hoffman!
-Yeah?

771
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,471
Copyright the name "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

772
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:37,806
How about "Green Meanie"?

773
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,060
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
That's slander.

774
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,563
It is not. I resent that.

775
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,566
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

776
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,401
You don't trust anybody.

777
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,611
I trust my barber.

778
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:53,989
What are you, his lawyer? Get out.

779
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:56,283
Let him sue me,
get rich like a normal person.

780
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,201
That's what made this country--

781
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,546
Jameson, you slime.

782
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,049
Who's the photographer
who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

783
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,093
I don't know.
His stuff comes by mail.

784
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,179
-You're lying!
-I swear.

785
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,347
He's the one
who can bring me to him.

786
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,434
-I don't know who he is.
-You are useless.

787
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,895
Set him down, tough guy.

788
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:29,149
-Speak of the devil.
-I knew you two were in this together!

789
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:32,527
Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?

790
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,197
Sleep....

791
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,673
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

792
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:58,261
No, you're not dead yet.

793
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,639
Just paralyzed...

794
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,766
...temporarily.

795
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,853
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

796
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,731
You and I are not so different.

797
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,777
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

798
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,863
Well, to each his own.

799
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,991
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

800
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:25,288
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

801
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:28,750
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

802
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,545
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

803
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:37,342
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

804
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,510
Why bother?

805
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:43,431
-Because it's right.
-Here's the real truth.

806
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,851
There are eight million people
in this city.

807
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:51,356
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

808
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:55,527
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

809
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:57,112
You, me...

810
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,614
...we're exceptional.

811
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,536
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

812
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:08,373
But l'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

813
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:12,168
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

814
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:15,130
What we could create.

815
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:17,716
Or we could destroy.

816
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,845
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

817
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,472
...again and again and again until
we're both dead.

818
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,933
Is that what you want?

819
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:31,813
Think about it, hero.

820
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:49,122
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

821
01:17:58,257 --> 01:17:59,257
Hey!

822
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,925
-It's me again.
-Hey!

823
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,719
How was your audition?

824
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,930
-How'd you know?
-The hot line. Your mom...

825
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,058
...told my aunt, told me.

826
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,851
So you just came by?

827
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:13,688
I was in the neighbourhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

828
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:17,567
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighbourhood, but....

829
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,195
So how'd it go?

830
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:24,949
They said I needed acting lessons.

831
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,870
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

832
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:34,376
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

833
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,796
I'd like a cheeseburger.

834
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,716
Oh, but l'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

835
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,551
Come with us.

836
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,471
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

837
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:50,892
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

838
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,894
It's not?

839
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:55,980
Why so interested?

840
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,149
I'm not.

841
01:18:58,401 --> 01:18:59,776
You're not?

842
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:04,155
-Well, why would I be?
-I don't know.

843
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:06,199
Why would you be?

844
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,412
I, that's a--

845
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,122
I don't know.

846
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:17,168
Sorry you won't come with us.

847
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,589
I better run, tiger.

848
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,308
Hey, check it out, man.

849
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,144
Come on, man.

850
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,942
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

851
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,295
Get off me!

852
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,079
Wait!

853
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:42,295
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

854
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:46,841
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

855
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,927
I was in the neighbourhood.

856
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,431
You are amazing.

857
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,101
Some people don't think so.

858
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:01,189
-But you are.
-Nice to have a fan.

859
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:05,151
Do I get to say thank you this time?

860
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,529
Wait.

861
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,683
Let me in! My baby's in there!

862
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,935
-Let me go!
-The roof's collapsing!

863
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:24,606
-Somebody save my baby!
-The roof's about to collapse!

864
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,149
Look! Up there!

865
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,616
Save my baby, please!

866
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,474
No!

867
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:11,194
-It's okay. Your baby's fine.
-Oh, my baby!

868
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,156
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

869
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,116
Don't let him get away!

870
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,578
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

871
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,997
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

872
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,250
I'm going.

873
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,589
-I'll be here when you get back.
-Not coming back, chief.

874
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,132
Go! Go!

875
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:47,397
Where are you?

876
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:55,154
I'm gonna get you out of here!

877
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,242
It's okay.

878
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,876
You're pathetically predictable.

879
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,962
Like a moth to the flame.

880
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:14,298
What about my generous proposal?

881
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:18,177
Are you in or are you out?

882
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,972
It's you who's out, Gobby.
Out of your mind.

883
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,391
Wrong answer.

884
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:26,227
Oh, great.

885
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:07,685
No one says no to me!

886
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:18,446
-M.J., will you stop goofing around?
-Harry, relax.

887
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,200
He's here.

888
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:25,620
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

889
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,998
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

890
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:32,293
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

891
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:35,838
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

892
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,883
Who is this lovely young lady?

893
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:43,346
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

894
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,224
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

895
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:50,144
-Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
-Now, where is Peter?

896
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:52,688
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

897
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:02,031
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

898
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:12,834
Peter?

899
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,295
Is that you?

900
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,930
How strange. There's nobody here.

901
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:36,899
-Bit of a slob, isn't he?
-All brilliant men are.

902
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:12,101
-Hey, everyone.
-Oh, Peter!

903
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,103
Sorry I'm late,
it's a jungle out there.

904
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:18,107
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

905
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,402
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

906
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,154
...and we can say grace.

907
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,324
Parker.

908
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,451
Here we go.

909
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,752
-There we are.
-It looks delicious.

910
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,754
Norman.

911
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,841
Will you do the honours?

912
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,773
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

913
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,360
Oh, yeah....

914
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:06,948
I stepped off a kerb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

915
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,658
Well, let me see.

916
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,451
Oh, my goodness.

917
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:13,037
-Oh, that looks awful.
-No, it's nothing.

918
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:16,332
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

919
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:21,837
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.

920
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:25,883
How did you say that happened?

921
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,010
Bike messenger.

922
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,179
Knocked me down.

923
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:39,313
-If you'll excuse me, l've got to go.
-Why?

924
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:43,526
Something
has come to my attention.

925
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:44,986
Are you all right?

926
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:48,698
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

927
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,701
-Enjoy the fruitcake.
-Dad!

928
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:57,665
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

929
01:28:57,874 --> 01:28:59,583
I've got to go.

930
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:04,005
-This girl is important to me.
-Harry, please. Look at her.

931
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:08,175
Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personality?

932
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:11,429
-What are you saying?
-Your mother was beautiful too.

933
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:12,763
They're all beautiful.

934
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:17,018
Until they're snarling after your trust
fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

935
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:18,519
You're wrong about her, Dad.

936
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:22,189
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend:

937
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:25,067
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

938
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:39,206
Thanks for sticking up for me,
Harry.

939
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,376
-You heard?
-Everyone heard that creep.

940
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:46,464
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

941
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,050
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

942
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,885
Harry Osborn!

943
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,013
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

944
01:29:56,975 --> 01:30:00,311
Spider-Man is all but invincible.

945
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,647
But Parker, we can destroy him.

946
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,149
I can't.

947
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:08,319
Betrayal
must not be countenanced.

948
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,821
Parker must be educated.

949
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:14,283
What do I do?

950
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:18,579
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

951
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:21,791
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.

952
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,334
Yes?

953
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,419
And then grant his wish.

954
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:27,630
But how?

955
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:32,134
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

956
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,511
Tell me how!

957
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,846
The heart, Osborn.

958
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:39,141
First, we attack his heart.

959
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:44,522
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

960
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:47,691
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

961
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,945
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us--

962
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:02,081
Deliver us!

963
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,666
Finish it!

964
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,878
-Finish it!
-From evil!

965
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,761
Two milligrams lV.

966
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:18,806
Get the BP.

967
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:22,810
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

968
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:24,353
You have to leave.

969
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,230
-What happened?
-Those eyes!

970
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:30,484
Those horrible yellow eyes!

971
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,867
He knows who I am.

972
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:23,412
I'm sorry.

973
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:29,585
-Will she be okay?
-She's gonna be fine.

974
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:32,421
She's been sleeping all day.

975
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:36,175
-Thanks for coming.
-Of course.

976
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:43,265
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

977
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:47,102
Yeah, l'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

978
01:32:47,354 --> 01:32:50,314
-Have you talked to Harry?
-He called me.

979
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,942
I haven't called him back.

980
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:56,737
The fact is...

981
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:00,741
-...I'm in love with somebody else.
-You are?

982
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,117
At least I think I am.

983
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:07,831
-It's not the right time to talk about it.
-No. Go on.

984
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:11,252
Would I know his name, this guy?

985
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:14,338
You'll think I'm a stupid little girl
with a crush.

986
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:15,881
Trust me.

987
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,383
It's funny.

988
01:33:19,386 --> 01:33:22,763
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

989
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,892
-Oh. Him.
-You're laughing at me.

990
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:30,062
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

991
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:33,565
But do you think it's true, all the
terrible things they say about him?

992
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:37,653
No, no. Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

993
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,488
I know him a little bit.

994
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:42,574
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

995
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:45,911
-Has he mentioned me?
-Yeah.

996
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,705
What'd he say?

997
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,623
I said....

998
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:55,004
He asked me
what I thought about you.

999
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,965
And what did you say?

1000
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:02,761
I said, "Spider-Man."

1001
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:07,975
I said, "The great thing about M.J...

1002
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,727


...is...

1003
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:13,897
...when you look in her eyes...

1004
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:19,653
...and she's looking back in yours...

1005
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,657
...everything feels...

1006
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,702
...not quite normal.

1007
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:29,747
Because you feel...

1008
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,915
...stronger...

1009
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:37,087
...and weaker at the same time.

1010
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,257
You feel excited...

1011
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:43,177
...and at the same time...

1012
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,429
...terrified.

1013
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:52,061
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

1014
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:57,107
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

1015
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:01,695
It's as if you've...

1016
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:05,491
...reached the unreachable...

1017
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:09,787
...and you weren't ready for it."

1018
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:15,000
You said that?

1019
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:18,128
Well, something like that.

1020
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:03,924
Dad?

1021
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:11,348
Dad, is that you?

1022
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,440
What is it?

1023
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:26,697
Well, you were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

1024
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,409
She's in love with Peter.

1025
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:32,494
-Parker?
-Yeah.

1026
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:34,621
And how does he feel about her?

1027
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,751
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1028
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:45,966
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1029
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:50,637
I'm so sorry.

1030
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:56,560
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

1031
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:01,523
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1032
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:03,525
That's no excuse.

1033
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:06,320
I'm proud of you.

1034
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:11,742
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.

1035
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:15,245
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1036
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:31,094
Wake up, little spider.

1037
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:32,763
Wake up.

1038
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:35,682
Go home, dear.

1039
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,226
You look awful.

1040
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:39,728
-And you look beautiful.
-Well, thank you.

1041
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:43,232
-I don't like to leave you here.
-But l'm safe here.

1042
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:46,109
-Can I do anything for you?
-You do too much.

1043
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:51,823
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1044
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:54,326
A smile. Finally.

1045
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:57,746
Haven't seen one of those on
your face since Mary Jane was here.

1046
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:01,291
Hey.
You were supposed to be asleep.

1047
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:06,880
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1048
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:11,051
And when she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1049
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:17,558
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1050
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:21,311
-Gee, did I say that?
-You sure did.

1051
01:38:23,982 --> 01:38:26,733
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1052
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:30,696
-She's still his girl.
-Well, isn't that up to her?

1053
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:35,492
-She doesn't really know who I am.
-Because you won't let her.

1054
01:38:35,702 --> 01:38:38,829
You're so mysterious all the time.

1055
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,832
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1056
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:46,003
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1057
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,922
Everybody else knows.

1058
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,218
I'll be right back.

1059
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,178
But....

1060
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,521
Come on, pick up.

1061
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:07,983
-Hey, M.J.--
-Sing your song at the beep.

1062
01:39:09,027 --> 01:39:11,069
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1063
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,197
Hello? You there?

1064
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:19,202
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1065
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,787
All right, well....

1066
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,247
Don't....

1067
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:25,250
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1068
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,960
Hello?

1069
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:33,091
Can Spider-Man come out to play?

1070
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,052
Where is she?

1071
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:22,974
-What is that?
-That's cool!

1072
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:27,813
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout

1073
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:32,150
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out

1074
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,669
Goblin, what have you done?

1075
01:41:33,171 --> 01:41:37,007
Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1076
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,009
Because you never know...

1077
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:44,014
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1078
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,684
Let die the woman you love...

1079
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:57,152
...or suffer the little children.

1080
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,990
-Spider-Man!
-Save us!

1081
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:04,785
Save us!

1082
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,621
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

1083
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:11,208
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1084
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,460
Don't do it, Goblin!

1085
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:16,546
We are who we choose to be.

1086
01:42:16,798 --> 01:42:19,549
-Now, choose!
-No!

1087
01:42:48,246 --> 01:42:49,830
Everybody stay still!

1088
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,674
Ahoy up there!

1089
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:03,760
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1090
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:15,397
-He's coming back!
-Listen. I need you to climb down.

1091
01:43:15,565 --> 01:43:17,065
-I can't.
-Yes, you can!

1092
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,198
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1093
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:26,950
Trust me.

1094
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:32,289
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1095
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:38,670
-Hurry!
-I can't. I can't do it.

1096
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,547
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1097
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:11,620
-He's not gonna make it.
-He's gonna make it!

1098
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:24,716
It's time to die.

1099
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,184
Come on up here, tough guy,
I got something for you!

1100
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:35,560
We ought to kick your ass!

1101
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:39,147
Leave Spider-Man alone! You're
gonna pick on a guy saving kids?

1102
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:41,274
I got something for your ass!

1103
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:43,318
Mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1104
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:45,946
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1105
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:01,336
Spider-Man, watch out!

1106
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:37,455
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1107
01:45:38,374 --> 01:45:41,001
I offered you friendship...

1108
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,044
...and you spat in my face.

1109
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:37,807
You've spun your last web,
Spider-Man.

1110
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:41,311
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death...

1111
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:43,188
...would have been quick
and painless.

1112
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:46,733
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1113
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:51,863
...I'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1114
01:46:56,452 --> 01:46:58,495
M.J. and I...

1115
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,624
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1116
01:47:56,428 --> 01:47:57,971
Peter, stop!

1117
01:47:58,139 --> 01:48:00,598
Stop! It's me.

1118
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:10,984
Mr. Osborn.

1119
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:12,777
Peter, thank God for you.

1120
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,280
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1121
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:18,533
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1122
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:20,451
Don't let him take me again.

1123
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:22,662
I beg you. Protect me.

1124
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:26,374
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1125
01:48:26,584 --> 01:48:28,084
But not you.

1126
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:32,714
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

1127
01:48:32,923 --> 01:48:35,008
I would never hurt you.

1128
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:37,135
I knew from the beginning...

1129
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:40,263
...if anything ever happened to me...

1130
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:42,599
...it was you I could count on.

1131
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:46,102
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1132
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:48,521
Thank God for you.

1133
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,940
Give me your hand.

1134
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:55,528
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

1135
01:48:56,947 --> 01:48:59,741
I've been like a father to you.

1136
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,952
Be a son to me now.

1137
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:06,623
I have a father.

1138
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:09,876
His name was Ben Parker.

1139
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:13,213
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1140
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:33,650
Peter.

1141
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:37,278
Don't tell Harry.

1142
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,229
What have you done?

1143
01:50:11,397 --> 01:50:12,981
What have you done?!

1144
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:37,755
Hey.

1145
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:43,177
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1146
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:47,223
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1147
01:50:49,393 --> 01:50:52,687
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1148
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:56,566
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1149
01:50:58,444 --> 01:51:01,571
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1150
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,411
Thank God for you, Peter.

1151
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:11,581
You're the only family I have.

1152
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:38,399
No matter what I do...

1153
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:41,694
...no matter how hard I try...

1154
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:46,115
...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.

1155
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:59,170
You must miss him so much.

1156
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:03,174
It's been so hard without him.

1157
01:52:06,095 --> 01:52:08,971
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1158
01:52:10,766 --> 01:52:12,600
When I was up there...

1159
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:16,104
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1160
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:20,483
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1161
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:26,072
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1162
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:29,492
It was you, Pete.

1163
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:32,703
I kept thinking:

1164
01:52:33,122 --> 01:52:35,915
"l hope I make it through this...

1165
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:41,754
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1166
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,632
Really?

1167
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:50,805
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1168
01:52:52,057 --> 01:52:54,016
...who makes me feel...

1169
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:58,187
...like l'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1170
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:01,983
That I'm just...

1171
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:04,152
...me.

1172
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,155
And that's okay.

1173
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:10,825
The truth is...

1174
01:53:12,953 --> 01:53:14,745
...I love you.

1175
01:53:16,832 --> 01:53:18,791
I love you so much, Peter.

1176
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:44,275
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.

1177
01:53:44,443 --> 01:53:46,360
I can't.

1178
01:53:48,489 --> 01:53:50,031
You can't what?

1179
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,617
Tell you...

1180
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:58,581
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1181
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:03,669
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1182
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,589
I want you to know...

1183
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:09,634
...that I will always be there
for you.

1184
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:13,804
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1185
01:54:14,806 --> 01:54:16,807
I promise you that.

1186
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:22,396
I will always be your friend.

1187
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:27,193
Only a friend...

1188
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:29,612
...Peter Parker?

1189
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:34,617
That's all I have to give.

1190
01:55:00,978 --> 01:55:03,646
Whatever life holds in store
for me...

1191
01:55:03,814 --> 01:55:06,691
...l will never forget these words:

1192
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:11,946
"With great power
comes great responsibility."

1193
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:14,365
This is my gift.

1194
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:16,659
My curse.

1195
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,078
Who am l?

1196
01:55:19,454 --> 01:55:20,830
I'm Spider-Man.
