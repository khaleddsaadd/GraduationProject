2
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:43,546
Do you, Ethan, take Julia
to be your lawful wedded wife?

3
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:44,646
I do.

4
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:49,580
To have, to hold, to love,
cherish, honor, and protect?

5
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,812
I do.

6
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:55,180
To shield from
terrors known and unknown?

7
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:58,147
- To lie, to deceive...
- What?

8
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:02,414
To live a double life, to fail
to prevent her abduction,

9
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:06,180
erase her identity,
force her into hiding,

10
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:07,812
take away
all she has known...

11
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:08,746
Stop.

12
00:01:08,748 --> 00:01:10,546
...in a selfish, futile,
fleeting attempt...

13
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:11,479
Stop.

14
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:14,180
...to escape
your own true self?

15
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:15,279
Please, stop.

16
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,813
And, Julia, do you
choose to accept?

17
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:19,080
Don't.

18
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:21,450
- I do.
- No.

19
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,012
You should have
killed me, Ethan.

20
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:55,983
Fate whispers
to the warrior...

21
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:58,645
A storm is coming.

22
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:00,848
And the
warrior whispers back...

23
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:04,882
I am the storm.

24
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:41,147
<i>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.</i>

25
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:43,514
<i>The anarchist Solomon Lane.</i>

26
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,214
<i>Since you captured him
2 years ago,</i>

27
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:49,347
<i>his absence from the world stage
has had unintended consequences.</i>

28
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:54,012
<i>His Syndicate of rogue covert operatives
continues to wreak havoc around the globe.</i>

29
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:55,979
<i>The CIA's
Special Activities Division</i>

30
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:59,346
<i>has relentlessly hunted Lane's
elite network of hostiles.</i>

31
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:01,813
<i>But many remain unknown
and at large.</i>

32
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,846
<i>The remnants of this
extremist splinter cell</i>

33
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:06,582
<i>refer to themselves as
"The Apostles."</i>

34
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:10,613
<i>They have since adopted
a policy of terror-for-hire,</i>

35
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:12,879
<i>making them
an even greater threat.</i>

36
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,413
<i>They are responsible for
the recent smallpox outbreak</i>

37
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:16,745
<i>in Indian-controlled Kashmir,</i>

38
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:19,046
<i>along the borders of China
and Pakistan,</i>

39
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:21,613
<i>threatening one-third
of the world's population.</i>

40
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:23,679
<i>The epidemic
is being contained,</i>

41
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,514
<i>but intelligence
would indicate</i>

42
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:29,679
<i>that a new client has hired the Apostles
for a more ambitious operation.</i>

43
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,380
<i>They have been contacted
by this man,</i>

44
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:35,380
<i>an unidentified extremist known
only by the code name John Lark,</i>

45
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,313
<i>author of this
apocalyptic manifesto</i>

46
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:40,713
<i>calling for the destruction
of the current world order.</i>

47
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:43,846
<i>It is believed Lark is responsible
for the disappearance</i>

48
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,047
<i>of Norwegian nuclear weapons
specialist Nils Delbruuk.</i>

49
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,379
<i>Dr. Delbruuk's security
clearance was revoked</i>

50
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:52,179
<i>after he expressed
fiercely anti-religious views.</i>

51
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:54,247
<i>Meanwhile, the Apostles
have been in contact</i>

52
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:56,712
<i>with elements of the Eastern
European underworld,</i>

53
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:59,079
<i>who are in possession
of three plutonium cores</i>

54
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,613
<i>stolen from a missile base
in eastern Russia.</i>

55
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:04,880
<i>This would indicate that
John Lark and the Apostles</i>

56
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:09,146
<i>are working together to acquire
functioning nuclear weapons.</i>

57
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,713
<i>NEST estimates that a man
with Delbruuk's knowledge,</i>

58
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,380
<i>using the materials in play,</i>

59
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:17,612
<i>could complete three nuclear
weapons in as little as 72 hours.</i>

60
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:19,246
<i>These devices would be
man-portable</i>

61
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:22,212
<i>and deployable anywhere
on Earth overnight.</i>

62
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:24,579
<i>In the hands of John Lark
and the Apostles,</i>

63
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,079
<i>these weapons represent
an unprecedented threat</i>

64
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:29,046
<i>to countless millions.</i>

65
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:31,347
<i>Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,</i>

66
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:34,079
<i>is to prevent the Apostles
from acquiring plutonium</i>

67
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,913
<i>using any means
at your disposal.</i>

68
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:40,613
<i>If you or any members of your
IMF team are caught or killed,</i>

69
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,713
<i>the Secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.</i>

70
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:44,912
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>

71
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:48,149
<i>This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

72
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:04,945
He's late.

73
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:07,913
- He's never late.
- He'll be here.

74
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:09,347
I don't like it.

75
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,012
Something about this guy just
really gives me the creeps.

76
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:15,079
Okay, just relax.

77
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,414
I'm relaxed.

78
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,545
You don't sound relaxed.

79
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:18,880
Luther, does he sound
relaxed to you?

80
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:20,912
He sounds terrified.

81
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:21,979
<i>Please,
I'm not terrified.</i>

82
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,645
<i>I just have
a bad feeling is all.</i>

83
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:25,413
<i>I thought you said
you were relaxed.</i>

84
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:28,979
It's entirely possible to be relaxed
and extremely uneasy at the same time.

85
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:30,912
- No, it's not.
- You do it all the time.

86
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,645
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

87
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:33,979
No, he doesn't.

88
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:35,779
I'm supposed to believe that
you are perfectly relaxed,

89
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:37,513
- right here, now...
- Benji.

90
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:40,712
...in a dark alleyway, waiting to buy
black-market plutonium from a psychopath.

91
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:42,513
Benji, I won't let anything
happen to you.

92
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:44,113
- Okay.
- <i>See, Benji,</i>

93
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:45,445
<i>you're perfectly safe.</i>

94
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:47,213
That's easy for you to say,
you're in the van.

95
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:49,079
Well, you wanted to be
in the field, tough guy.

96
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,180
And tonight, Luther, I would
like to be in the van!

97
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:53,080
He's here.

98
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:54,716
Oh, God.

99
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:11,513
<i>Have that
money ready, Luther.</i>

100
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:12,781
Copy.

101
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:18,979
Ethan, do you copy?

102
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,581
Do you copy?

103
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:35,350
Are we finally gonna
do this or not?

104
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:45,682
I have survived in this business
with the help of a voice in my head.

105
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:51,313
This voice is never wrong.
And whenever I meet you,

106
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:53,048
it tells me the same thing.

107
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,082
What's that?

108
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:57,282
Nothing.

109
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:05,915
I'm here to do business. Tell
the voice to flip a coin.

110
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:38,880
What's that?

111
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:40,945
This is a beryllium rod,
which is causing

112
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:44,212
a reaction with the plutonium
inside the core.

113
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:54,249
That's them.

114
00:07:57,181 --> 00:07:58,250
The money?

115
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:00,982
The money.

116
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,115
Bring the money.

117
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,281
Luther, bring the money.

118
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:30,015
We're gonna need
that money, Luther.

119
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:31,745
Kill them.

120
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,415
I got it!

121
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,012
Luther, do you copy?

122
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:45,146
Luther!

123
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,546
Luther, come in.

124
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:48,213
<i>Luther's not here
right now.</i>

125
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:51,745
<i>What can the Apostles
do for you, Hunt?</i>

126
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:54,713
- What do you want?
- <i>You're boxed in, Hunt.</i>

127
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:57,912
<i>Give us the plutonium
and walk away.</i>

128
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,813
Benji, get the car.

129
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:01,546
- I don't think I can do that.
- Benji.

130
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:03,315
Get the car.

131
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,379
We'll make you
a deal, Hunt.

132
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,449
Give us the plutonium and
we won't kill your friend.

133
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,049
Don't you do it, Ethan!
Not for me!

134
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:49,815
I'm gonna
count to three.

135
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,548
One.

136
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:55,082
- Two.
- Luther...

137
00:09:55,748 --> 00:09:57,215
- ...I'm sorry.
- Three.

138
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:14,646
I'm sorry. I didn't know
what else to do.

139
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,147
We're good.

140
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,980
- You okay?
- I should be dead.

141
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:23,916
We should all be dead.

142
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:27,214
Why aren't we?

143
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:29,249
Where's the plutonium?

144
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:42,949
It's gone.

145
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:48,478
<i>If you're just joining us,</i>

146
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,979
<i>three massive explosions
have gone off simultaneously</i>

147
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:55,545
<i>in what appears to be
a coordinated attack.</i>

148
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:58,979
<i>This image is live in Rome,
looking toward the Vatican</i>

149
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:01,379
<i>and is as close as
our cameras can get.</i>

150
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:04,679
<i>It is believed that
the Pope was in residence</i>

151
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,178
<i>at the time of the blast.</i>

152
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,078
<i>Also live, we're looking at Jerusalem
from just outside the city.</i>

153
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,378
<i>Also live,
the holy city of Mecca</i>

154
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,445
<i>from the USS Ronald Reagan in the Red
Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia.</i>

155
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:19,313
<i>Radiation has been detected,</i>

156
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:22,613
<i>indicating that
nuclear weapons were used</i>

157
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,513
<i>in these unspeakable attacks.</i>

158
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,512
Ethan, it's time.

159
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:28,078
<i>No word on casualties yet,
but we can assume</i>

160
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,946
<i>the death toll
is catastrophic.</i>

161
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:32,246
<i>Early reports suggest
the weapons used</i>

162
00:11:32,248 --> 00:11:34,913
<i>would require
highly specialized knowledge</i>

163
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:36,879
<i>that very few people possess.</i>

164
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:42,145
<i>The question now is who would attack all
three of these holy sites? And why?</i>

165
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:45,479
<i>The attacks occurred
at precisely the same moment,</i>

166
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:46,845
<i>just over an hour ago,</i>

167
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,413
<i>at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</i>

168
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:49,745
<i>Within minutes
of the attack...</i>

169
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:52,445
<i>...Congress ordered
an emergency recess</i>

170
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,245
<i>and the Capitol Building
was evacuated.</i>

171
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,145
<i>The President left Washington
on Air Force One.</i>

172
00:11:57,147 --> 00:11:59,446
<i>The White House has declared
a state of emergency,</i>

173
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:01,945
<i>placing the military
on highest alert.</i>

174
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,248
Would you excuse us, please?

175
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:07,578
Dr. Delbruuk.

176
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:10,412
We know who you are.

177
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:13,448
We read the manifesto,
we found your lab.

178
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:25,212
"There has never been peace

179
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:27,278
"without first
a great suffering.

180
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,979
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

181
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:33,445
See, this will
unite them. Hmm?

182
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:35,980
When they read this manifesto,
they'll all understand.

183
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,845
Nobody's gonna
read that manifesto, ever.

184
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:40,813
I can promise you that.

185
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:42,211
What day is it?

186
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,945
How long have I been here?

187
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,581
What's the last thing
you remember?

188
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:48,682
I was driving.

189
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:51,745
Someone hit me.

190
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:53,481
That was two weeks ago.

191
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:55,746
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks.

192
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:57,812
This is yours,
isn't it?

193
00:12:57,814 --> 00:13:00,478
It's how Lark
communicated with you.

194
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,312
- Lark?
- John Lark.

195
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,578
- We know all about him.
- You know nothing.

196
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,546
There's information in this
phone that could lead us to him.

197
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:09,179
And you have
the passcode.

198
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:11,616
You think
Lark is the enemy, hmm?

199
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:14,045
But you,

200
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:17,146
well, whoever you are,
you are the enemy.

201
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:19,513
You're why
the system survives.

202
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,912
- Why the suffering goes on.
- Shut up!

203
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,313
We don't care about you.
We want Lark.

204
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:25,779
What if we make a deal?

205
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,214
No,
there's no deal, Luther.

206
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,945
Step outside.

207
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:31,445
Give me five minutes
with this guy.

208
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:34,111
Ethan, I can't let you do that.
That's not who we are.

209
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,613
Then maybe we need to
reconsider that.

210
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,145
What if they read
the manifesto on the air?

211
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:40,211
What? You can do that?

212
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:42,081
We can do it
with a phone call.

213
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,912
Well, if he reads
Lark's manifesto...

214
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:47,011
No.

215
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:48,748
I'll give you the passcode.

216
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:50,879
Ethan! Ethan!

217
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,512
Think, Ethan.

218
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:54,845
Think of the greater good,
please.

219
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,448
Yeah, you do that.

220
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:05,214
Hmm?

221
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:11,713
Sir.

222
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:14,146
No, he won't cooperate.

223
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:17,315
Yes, sir.
If we read the manifesto

224
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:19,782
on the air.

225
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:23,782
I'm sorry, sir.

226
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:33,713
<i>Trading
and global markets plummeted.</i>

227
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:39,378
<i>Stand by. I'm told we're about to
get some additional information.</i>

228
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,378
<i>I've just been handed a
document from Nils Delbruuk,</i>

229
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,413
<i>a nuclear weapons specialist</i>

230
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:48,845
<i>who claims to have built the
weapons used in these attacks.</i>

231
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:53,378
<i>I've been asked to read this
manifesto in its entirety.</i>

232
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,978
<i>"There has never been peace</i>

233
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,779
<i>"without first
a great suffering.</i>

234
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:59,011
<i>"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.</i>

235
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:03,146
<i>"As mankind is drawn
to his self-destruction</i>

236
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:05,011
<i>"like a moth to the candle,</i>

237
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:06,979
<i>"the so-called
defenders of peace,</i>

238
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:09,713
<i>"the church, the government,
the law,</i>

239
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:12,978
<i>"work tirelessly
to save humanity from itself."</i>

240
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,679
It's not gonna
help you now.

241
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,379
<i>"But by averting disaster,</i>

242
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:18,146
<i>"they serve
to delay a peace..."</i>

243
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:19,545
What's done is done.

244
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:22,512
<i>"...that can only come through
an inevitable baptism of fire.</i>

245
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:25,979
<i>"The suffering I bring you is
not the beginning of the end.</i>

246
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:27,146
<i>"It is the beginning</i>

247
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:28,612
<i>"of a greater mutual
understanding..."</i>

248
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:29,881
Did we get it?

249
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,279
<i>"It is the first step</i>

250
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,845
<i>"toward the ultimate
brotherhood of man."</i>

251
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:35,012
We got it.

252
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:36,479
<i>"The suffering I bring you</i>

253
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,315
<i>"is the bridge
to ultimate peace."</i>

254
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:39,914
Go.

255
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:55,211
Did we get it?

256
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:56,880
Of course we got it.

257
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:06,716
I told you we'd get it.

258
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:09,247
I don't understand.

259
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:11,313
The attacks
didn't happen?

260
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:15,146
The car accident you were
in, that was an hour ago.

261
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,181
I was driving
the other car.

262
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:19,245
What's done is done,

263
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:21,248
when we say it's done.

264
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:36,613
Sir.

265
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:39,345
That phone you unlocked
led us to a server in Iceland

266
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:41,312
where we managed to
decrypt a communique

267
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:43,845
between John Lark
and this woman:

268
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:46,479
Alana Mitsopolis,
activist and philanthropist,

269
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:47,680
whose charity work

270
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,245
has earned her
the nickname the White Widow.

271
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:52,779
It's all a front for her real trade:
arms dealing, money laundering.

272
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,479
Extensive political connections
provide her with protection.

273
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:56,844
Lark and the Widow
are meeting tonight

274
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:59,978
to negotiate delivery
of an unspecified package,

275
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,944
which we can only assume
is our missing plutonium.

276
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:06,211
They'll make contact in a private
lounge at the Grand Palais in Paris

277
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:07,879
during her annual
fundraising event.

278
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,111
The details are in the file.

279
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:10,312
If Lark isn't there
by midnight,

280
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:12,378
the Widow will leave

281
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,944
and sell the package
to the highest bidder.

282
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:17,646
Which gives you two hours
from now to find Lark.

283
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:20,178
Sir, I think there's
something you need to know.

284
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,744
I'm gonna
stop you right there.

285
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:24,613
You had a terrible choice
to make in Berlin:

286
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:26,446
Recover the plutonium
or save your team.

287
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:28,616
You chose your team,
and now the world is at risk.

288
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:32,145
Some flaw
deep in your core being

289
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:35,745
simply won't allow you to choose
between one life and millions.

290
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,513
You see that
as a sign of weakness.

291
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:40,078
To me, that's your
greatest strength.

292
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,944
It also tells me I can count
on you to cover my ass.

293
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:46,379
Because coming over here from the CIA was
a lateral move, some say a step down.

294
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:47,915
But I did it

295
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,915
because of you.

296
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:52,048
Don't make me regret it.

297
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:05,715
Make the call.

298
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,681
Shut 'em down.

299
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:22,513
What do you think
you're doing, Erika?

300
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:24,179
It may be your mission,

301
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,312
but this is the CIA's plane.

302
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:28,146
It doesn't take off
without my say-so.

303
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:29,878
We don't have time for this.

304
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,879
I have a team in Paris ready to grab
Lark as soon as he leaves the Palais.

305
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,844
A G5 standing by
to rendition him to Gitmo,

306
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,445
where a waterboard
is waiting.

307
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:40,711
Spend 24 hours we don't have to
pull a confession we can't trust

308
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,911
from a man we haven't
positively identified? No.

309
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:46,712
We need reliable intelligence,
and we need it now.

310
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:49,512
This scenario is precisely
why the IMF exists!

311
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:51,911
The IMF is Halloween, Alan.

312
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:55,744
A bunch of grown men in rubber
masks playing trick-or-treat.

313
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:58,378
And if he had held on to
the plutonium in Berlin,

314
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,479
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

315
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:01,978
And his team
would be dead.

316
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,012
Yes. They would.

317
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:05,212
That's the job.

318
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:09,011
And that's why I want one
of my own men on the scene

319
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:11,379
to appraise the situation.

320
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,645
Agent Walker,
Special Activities.

321
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,245
His reputation precedes.

322
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:18,014
You use a scalpel.

323
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:20,612
I prefer a hammer.

324
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:22,146
The answer is no.

325
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:24,645
I have operational authority
here, direct from the President.

326
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,046
You have a problem with that,
you take it up with him.

327
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:29,844
I have already, and he agrees with me.
My man goes

328
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:31,881
or no one goes.

329
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:41,778
No one comes between
you and that plutonium.

330
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,014
Not Hunt, not his team,
not anyone.

331
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,577
<i>The White Widow has spies
at every level of government.</i>

332
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,778
This plane is posing
as a commercial airliner

333
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,245
so we can jump
into France undetected.

334
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:14,111
The Widow's meeting Lark
in the VIP lounge at midnight.

335
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:17,745
No one will be admitted without a
pre-issued electronic I.D. band.

336
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:19,745
We have acquired
the unique RFID number

337
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:21,947
for Lark's band,
allowing us to locate it

338
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,245
with these.

339
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,647
Find that I.D. band,
you find Lark.

340
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:28,781
Then what?

341
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,146
Then...

342
00:21:33,148 --> 00:21:36,911
I assume his identity and
make contact with the Widow.

343
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,045
She takes us
to the package.

344
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,545
People actually
fall for this shit?

345
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:45,048
How do you intend
to make Lark cooperate?

346
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:49,211
I bump him in the crowd.

347
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:51,779
In ten seconds he'll look like
any other drunk at the party,

348
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:54,179
incoherent
and completely pliable.

349
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:55,711
After I borrow his face,

350
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:58,179
you walk him out the front door and
hand him to Sloane's extraction team.

351
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:00,512
You're not getting rid of me
that easily, Hunt.

352
00:22:00,514 --> 00:22:02,245
That's not
what this is about.

353
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:03,878
Sure it is.

354
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,012
I know you don't want me
on this detail.

355
00:22:07,014 --> 00:22:08,544
But let's face it:

356
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:10,477
If you'd made
the hard choice in Berlin,

357
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:11,878
I wouldn't be here.

358
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,413
And if you hadn't
gunned down

359
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,711
every Syndicate agent
they sent you to find,

360
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:17,678
I wouldn't be here.

361
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,346
That's right,
I know all about you.

362
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:22,612
You're why we don't have a living
witness who can identify John Lark

363
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:24,444
or the Apostles.

364
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:27,146
If you have a problem
with my methods,

365
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:28,978
you can always stay behind.

366
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,644
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

367
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:34,911
Isn't that the thing?

368
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,911
<i>Two minutes to decompression.</i>

369
00:22:37,913 --> 00:22:41,915
Suit up. The Widow is
meeting Lark in 30 minutes.

370
00:22:57,947 --> 00:23:00,815
<i>Ten seconds
to decompression.</i>

371
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,114
Is your oxygen on?

372
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:09,578
There is no atmosphere
at this altitude.

373
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,612
I don't need you
blacking out on me.

374
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:17,212
Hey, your heads-up display has
a built-in guidance system.

375
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:18,478
Follow it to the target.

376
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,112
Open your chute
when the system says,

377
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:21,912
not before and
definitely not after,

378
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:23,679
or the last thing that
goes through your mind

379
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,578
will be your kneecaps.
Is that clear?

380
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,848
Crystal.

381
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,179
We got to talk.
We need to rethink this.

382
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,378
Out of my way, Hunt.

383
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,411
Walker, we've got a problem.
There's a storm. We need to...

384
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:56,477
Enough talk.

385
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,214
I'll see you in Paris.

386
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:06,678
Come on, come on, come on.

387
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:22,281
<i>Altitude: 25,000 feet.</i>

388
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:29,378
Walker?

389
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,344
What's the matter, Hunt?
You afraid of a little lightning?

390
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,779
<i>Altitude: 20,000 feet.</i>

391
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:45,645
Son of a bitch.

392
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,780
Walker?

393
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,448
Do you copy?

394
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:54,281
Walker?

395
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,547
Walker?

396
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,644
Come on.

397
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:10,413
<i>Altitude: 15,000 feet.</i>

398
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,081
Walker.

399
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,147
Walker!

400
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:29,314
Walker!

401
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:31,712
Walker!

402
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:34,377
<i>Altitude: 10,000 feet.</i>

403
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:38,812
<i>9,000.</i>

404
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:40,247
Oh, shit.

405
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:44,048
<i>8,000.</i>

406
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:48,448
<i>7,000.</i>

407
00:25:52,048 --> 00:25:53,381
<i>6,000.</i>

408
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,114
<i>5,000.</i>

409
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:02,478
<i>4,000.</i>

410
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,481
Walker!

411
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,081
Walker!

412
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:07,012
<i>3,000.</i>

413
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:09,477
<i>Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.</i>

414
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,779
<i>Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.</i>

415
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:14,082
<i>Deploy. Deploy.</i>

416
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,448
Oh, God.

417
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:51,448
Looks like
you lost your oxygen.

418
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:16,514
That's where the Widow
is meeting Lark.

419
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,046
<i>Ethan.</i>

420
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:02,644
- Walker.
- Ethan, if you can hear me,

421
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:03,844
I've got him.

422
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:06,744
Say again. Where?

423
00:28:06,746 --> 00:28:08,481
<i>He's headed for the bathroom.</i>

424
00:30:03,313 --> 00:30:05,844
- Where's the needle?
- Didn't need it.

425
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,180
Get him up.

426
00:30:35,913 --> 00:30:38,211
Hey, hey.

427
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,580
Shit.

428
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:23,645
- Can you still make a mask?
- I need a face to make a mask.

429
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:27,280
Sorry. I was aiming
for his chest.

430
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:30,944
- What are you doing here?
- It's good to see you, too.

431
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:33,581
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
You are...

432
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:36,981
An old friend.

433
00:33:49,713 --> 00:33:52,247
Cancel extraction.
We're code blue.

434
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:54,615
Send sanitation.

435
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,747
North men's room.

436
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,877
You didn't answer my question.
What are you doing here?

437
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:06,511
That's it. Just take it easy.
That's it.

438
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:08,545
Just keep your head back
until the bleeding stops.

439
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,780
What is it? Eh?

440
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:16,311
You're not here by accident.
Who sent you?

441
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:17,843
I can't tell you that.

442
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:18,710
What are you doing?

443
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:20,144
I have a date
with the White Widow.

444
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:23,110
He had a date with the Widow.
You look nothing like him.

445
00:34:23,112 --> 00:34:25,378
And now we have to hope
they never met.

446
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,778
- Hope is not a strategy!
- Oh, you must be new.

447
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,644
I have no other choice.

448
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:31,377
The White Widow's
our only lead.

449
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:32,944
I got to be this guy
for five minutes.

450
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,312
- Don't do it.
- What?

451
00:34:35,314 --> 00:34:37,843
What is it?
What aren't you telling me?

452
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:39,478
You don't understand
what you're involved in.

453
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,512
I don't understand
what I'm involved in.

454
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:44,047
I don't understand
what I'm involved in?

455
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:47,877
What am I involved in?

456
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,946
If you're meeting the Widow,
she leaves in three minutes.

457
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:54,010
- Ethan!
- I'll make it work.

458
00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:55,779
- Ethan!
- I'll make it work.

459
00:34:58,347 --> 00:34:59,778
The name's Walker.

460
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,946
Yeah? You're welcome.

461
00:35:21,112 --> 00:35:22,245
What do you think
you're doing?

462
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:23,678
- I'm going with you.
- Like hell you are.

463
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,010
People have been
sent here to kill Lark.

464
00:35:25,012 --> 00:35:25,877
No shit.

465
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:28,545
No, not me. Contractors.
Paid assassins.

466
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:29,911
They don't know
what he looks like,

467
00:35:29,913 --> 00:35:31,677
they only know he's meeting
the Widow at midnight.

468
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,145
If you go through with this,

469
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:35,411
they're gonna believe you're
Lark and they're gonna kill you.

470
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:36,913
How do you know all this?

471
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:40,447
I can't tell you that.

472
00:35:42,612 --> 00:35:44,946
You should've stayed out
of the game.

473
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,879
You should've come with me.

474
00:35:57,013 --> 00:36:01,445
This charity was started
in honor of my mother.

475
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:04,511
Those of you who knew her
understood her strength,

476
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:07,312
her tenacity,
her resourcefulness.

477
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,245
But there was
another side to her,

478
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:13,511
a side most people
never saw.

479
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:17,145
It is that part of her spirit
that has brought us

480
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:19,512
all together tonight.

481
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:22,714
Max was something
of a paradox.

482
00:36:24,646 --> 00:36:28,110
She had a fascination
for paradoxes,

483
00:36:28,112 --> 00:36:30,980
a fascination
she passed on to me.

484
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:37,611
Max had no illusions about
the world we live in today.

485
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:41,678
But she had dreams
of a very different future.

486
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,011
One in which her unique talents
were no longer required.

487
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:48,944
All she earned from
the way the world is

488
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:53,277
went ultimately to making it
what it could someday be.

489
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:56,844
That future isn't here yet.

490
00:36:56,846 --> 00:37:02,110
Tonight, your contributions have
brought it just a little closer.

491
00:37:05,446 --> 00:37:07,345
Thank you all for coming.

492
00:37:07,347 --> 00:37:09,013
Enjoy the party.

493
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:32,679
You can't possibly
be John Lark.

494
00:37:35,946 --> 00:37:37,814
I'm not, actually.

495
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,213
It's an alias.

496
00:37:42,713 --> 00:37:44,910
I suppose it's better
than John Doe.

497
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:46,378
Is there another name
you prefer?

498
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,045
Is there somewhere
we could talk privately?

499
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:50,511
In fact I like "Lark."
It does have a certain ring.

500
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:51,611
We don't have a lot of time.

501
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:53,110
'Cause I'll be honest.

502
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:55,779
A man of your reputation,
I was expecting someone

503
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,378
uglier.

504
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,111
Don't let looks deceive.
I'm as ugly as they come.

505
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,780
And I'll be honest with you.
Your life is in danger.

506
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,511
Don't you touch her.

507
00:38:06,513 --> 00:38:08,714
Relax. It's my brother.

508
00:38:09,713 --> 00:38:12,044
You're being rude
to our guest, Zola.

509
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:13,577
It's time to go.

510
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:15,913
Don't turn this into a scene.

511
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,714
You don't want to
be with this one.

512
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:29,377
- You were saying?
- Your life is in danger.

513
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:30,677
And who would
want to kill me?

514
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,377
The Americans,
for starters.

515
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:33,910
If that were true,
I would know it.

516
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:37,044
You think you're the only one
with spies in the government?

517
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:40,378
There are people here who don't
want this meeting to happen.

518
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,847
Don't believe me?

519
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,847
Look around.

520
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:57,777
I know
what you're thinking.

521
00:38:57,779 --> 00:38:59,811
Maybe they're not
here for you.

522
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:02,177
Maybe they're just
here for me.

523
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:04,646
Are you willing
to take that chance?

524
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:07,377
You have something I want.

525
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,810
Right now, that makes me
the only person you can trust

526
00:39:09,812 --> 00:39:11,977
to get you out of here alive.

527
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:14,646
Or would you rather leave
that to your brother?

528
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:22,313
I think I'd like to go
home now, Mr. Lark.

529
00:41:37,113 --> 00:41:40,244
The French government took receipt
of the asset at noon today.

530
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:42,610
Delivery will be via air
to the Finance Ministry

531
00:41:42,612 --> 00:41:44,311
at 8:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

532
00:41:44,313 --> 00:41:46,244
An armored motorcade
under heavy police escort

533
00:41:46,246 --> 00:41:48,778
will transport him
via this route.

534
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,011
We'll create a diversion
at this intersection, here.

535
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,744
The motorcade will
automatically take

536
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:56,410
the preplanned
alternate route here,

537
00:41:56,412 --> 00:41:58,412
where we'll extract
the asset.

538
00:41:59,613 --> 00:42:01,547
Extract the asset?

539
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:14,047
The asset.

540
00:42:15,913 --> 00:42:18,877
We paid a great deal of
money for this information.

541
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:21,410
They gave us everything
but this man's name.

542
00:42:21,412 --> 00:42:24,246
You don't happen to know
who he is, do you?

543
00:42:25,345 --> 00:42:27,010
His name is Solomon Lane.

544
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:29,946
British Special Agent
turned anarchist.

545
00:42:30,745 --> 00:42:32,843
He used rogue
covert operatives

546
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:35,279
to create a terror network
called the Syndicate.

547
00:42:36,212 --> 00:42:39,477
Sabotage, assassination,
mass murder.

548
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:42,077
As ugly as they come.

549
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,576
He was captured by
American agents two years ago.

550
00:42:45,578 --> 00:42:48,811
Since then, he's been in
a never-ending interrogation,

551
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,179
passed around from
one government to another

552
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:54,779
to answer for his crimes.

553
00:42:57,445 --> 00:42:59,843
You seem displeased, Lark.

554
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,779
Perhaps I didn't
make myself clear.

555
00:43:03,578 --> 00:43:06,111
I came to Paris
for plutonium.

556
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:08,778
Well, there must be
a misunderstanding.

557
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,778
I'm just a broker.

558
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,376
I connect a buyer
and a seller.

559
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:17,380
My seller's not interested in cash,
so if you want the plutonium...

560
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:19,879
Extract Lane

561
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:22,543
and make a trade.

562
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:23,879
That's right.

563
00:43:28,211 --> 00:43:30,479
How do I know the seller
has what I want?

564
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:52,777
A down payment
in good faith.

565
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:55,910
A courier will deliver
two more within 48 hours

566
00:43:55,912 --> 00:43:58,512
in exchange for him.

567
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,047
All right.

568
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:11,013
What happens
after the diversion?

569
00:45:44,613 --> 00:45:46,410
Kill everyone?

570
00:45:46,412 --> 00:45:48,009
That's your plan?

571
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,744
There will be no witnesses.

572
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:53,077
What's my guarantee that Lane
walks out of this thing alive?

573
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,143
He's in an armored box.

574
00:45:55,145 --> 00:45:57,810
We'll pull him out
when it's safe.

575
00:45:57,812 --> 00:45:59,279
You want your plutonium,

576
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:01,546
this is the price.

577
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:05,943
Or do you draw the line
at killing cops?

578
00:46:05,945 --> 00:46:08,312
That's John Lark
you're talking to.

579
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:14,579
I murder women and children
with smallpox.

580
00:46:16,813 --> 00:46:18,613
I have no line.

581
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,176
Right.

582
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:27,380
Sleep well, everyone.
Busy day tomorrow.

583
00:46:47,278 --> 00:46:49,544
<i>You have
got to be kidding me.</i>

584
00:46:49,546 --> 00:46:52,344
If you want Lane out of prison,
this is how it gets done.

585
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:55,344
I wanted Lark to break
him out, not Ethan Hunt.

586
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:59,576
I wanted Lark at the
exchange, not Ethan Hunt.

587
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:02,711
I wanted Lark to lead us
to the plutonium

588
00:47:02,713 --> 00:47:04,343
and the Apostles.

589
00:47:04,345 --> 00:47:06,109
You may still
get your chance.

590
00:47:06,111 --> 00:47:07,910
Have you forgotten about
the corpse we pulled

591
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:09,310
out of the men's room
at the Grand Palais?

592
00:47:09,312 --> 00:47:11,209
I'm guessing
that wasn't Lark.

593
00:47:11,211 --> 00:47:12,811
More likely
one of Lark's recruits.

594
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:15,277
Not according
to our intelligence.

595
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:17,413
Intelligence gathered
by whom?

596
00:47:19,645 --> 00:47:21,576
Hunt.

597
00:47:21,578 --> 00:47:25,209
You've long held suspicions that
Lark was an American agent.

598
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:26,977
Someone who knew
our every move.

599
00:47:26,979 --> 00:47:29,347
Someone who could
come and go like a ghost.

600
00:47:30,578 --> 00:47:34,343
You're suggesting
Hunt is John Lark.

601
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:38,810
You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

602
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:40,444
It won't work.

603
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:43,843
Think about it. Would a man
as careful as Lark

604
00:47:43,845 --> 00:47:45,942
really stick his neck out
like that?

605
00:47:45,944 --> 00:47:48,210
For a face-to-face
with the White Widow?

606
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:50,977
- He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.

607
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:52,543
And if he was really smart,

608
00:47:52,545 --> 00:47:55,310
he'd have his lady friend
kill that decoy

609
00:47:55,312 --> 00:47:57,511
in front of
a reliable witness.

610
00:47:57,513 --> 00:47:58,743
Me.

611
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:02,210
The dragnet is closing in
on his terrorist alter ego.

612
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,943
So he pays a man
to play the part of Lark

613
00:48:04,945 --> 00:48:06,744
and has him killed.

614
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:09,544
And under the guise
of serving his country...

615
00:48:09,546 --> 00:48:12,209
Assumes his own
secret identity.

616
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:13,611
Free to operate at will

617
00:48:13,613 --> 00:48:15,677
with the full support
of the U.S. government.

618
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:17,244
Why?

619
00:48:17,246 --> 00:48:19,376
Why would Hunt turn?

620
00:48:19,378 --> 00:48:23,177
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his Apostles?

621
00:48:23,179 --> 00:48:26,244
They were believers
in a cause.

622
00:48:26,246 --> 00:48:28,510
And when that cause
turned out to be a lie,

623
00:48:28,512 --> 00:48:31,411
they turned
against their masters.

624
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:34,842
How many times has Hunt's
government betrayed him,

625
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:36,976
disavowed him,
cast him aside?

626
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:40,009
And how long before
a man like that

627
00:48:40,011 --> 00:48:42,109
has had enough?

628
00:48:42,111 --> 00:48:44,845
That is
a serious accusation.

629
00:48:46,578 --> 00:48:48,179
Can you prove it?

630
00:48:51,613 --> 00:48:53,710
This is the phone
we pulled off the dead body

631
00:48:53,712 --> 00:48:55,212
at the Grand Palais.

632
00:49:00,379 --> 00:49:02,912
I'm guessing it has
all the proof you need.

633
00:51:06,612 --> 00:51:09,945
Is it true Lane gassed
a village of 2,000 people?

634
00:51:12,546 --> 00:51:13,610
Yes.

635
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,044
Is it true he brought down
an entire passenger plane

636
00:51:16,046 --> 00:51:17,046
just to kill one man?

637
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:19,846
Yes.

638
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:23,343
- Is it true that he...
- Hey, Walker.

639
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:26,144
Whatever you heard,
if it makes your skin crawl,

640
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:27,812
it's probably true.

641
00:51:33,812 --> 00:51:35,412
Holy shit.

642
00:51:36,778 --> 00:51:39,379
You're the guy that
caught him, aren't you?

643
00:51:41,046 --> 00:51:42,177
How long do you think

644
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:43,778
he's gonna keep that
to himself?

645
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:50,012
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

646
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:20,678
What the hell
is he doing?

647
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,009
Hunt? Where are you?

648
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:36,710
Don't wait for me!

649
00:56:36,712 --> 00:56:39,442
<i>What is it? What's wrong?</i>

650
00:56:39,444 --> 00:56:40,980
I'll meet you at the garage.

651
00:56:50,745 --> 00:56:52,213
Benji, do you copy?

652
00:56:52,645 --> 00:56:53,943
We copy. Go.

653
00:56:53,945 --> 00:56:57,311
<i>Change of plan. I'm blown.
Need extraction.</i>

654
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:58,980
We're on our way.

655
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:44,079
Get in the car.

656
01:02:14,477 --> 01:02:16,412
Zola wants a word with you.

657
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:04,678
We got to go.

658
01:03:07,377 --> 01:03:08,746
Come on.

659
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:47,143
The name's Walker,
by the way.

660
01:03:47,145 --> 01:03:49,346
Was the little car
your idea?

661
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:01,442
Jesus Christ!

662
01:04:01,444 --> 01:04:03,379
What the hell was that?

663
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:11,511
- Everybody out.
- Go, go, go!

664
01:06:48,712 --> 01:06:49,978
That was Ilsa.

665
01:06:50,744 --> 01:06:52,409
Shut up.

666
01:06:52,411 --> 01:06:54,279
Very interesting.

667
01:06:57,444 --> 01:06:59,911
It's good to see you again,
Ethan.

668
01:07:36,577 --> 01:07:39,645
Oh, look who's still alive.

669
01:07:43,277 --> 01:07:45,209
There's a microwave tracker
in his neck.

670
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:46,776
Got it.
You know what to do.

671
01:07:46,778 --> 01:07:49,209
Let me just assure you,
this won't hurt

672
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:50,712
enough.

673
01:07:52,711 --> 01:07:55,310
Ninety seconds.

674
01:07:55,312 --> 01:07:57,275
You and your Apostles think
we're gonna trade you

675
01:07:57,277 --> 01:07:58,909
for the missing plutonium.

676
01:07:58,911 --> 01:08:01,741
I'm here to tell you
that's never gonna happen.

677
01:08:01,743 --> 01:08:05,378
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

678
01:08:06,178 --> 01:08:08,108
I wonder, Ethan,

679
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:10,309
did you ever choose not to?

680
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:11,842
Did you ever stop
and ask yourself

681
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:15,343
who it was giving you
the orders or why?

682
01:08:15,345 --> 01:08:20,142
While every day the master you serve moves
one step closer to ending the world.

683
01:08:20,144 --> 01:08:22,309
Strange accusation
coming from a terrorist.

684
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:23,610
Sixty seconds.

685
01:08:23,612 --> 01:08:25,575
Terrorists are schoolboys
desperate for attention,

686
01:08:25,577 --> 01:08:29,409
hoping to shape
public opinion through fear.

687
01:08:29,411 --> 01:08:32,941
I don't care in the least
what people think or feel.

688
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:35,510
In my experience, they don't
do either for very long.

689
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:37,641
Oh, and I suppose that
justifies bombing factories

690
01:08:37,643 --> 01:08:39,475
or bringing down
civilian aircraft.

691
01:08:39,477 --> 01:08:41,842
Or strapping me
into an explosive vest!

692
01:08:41,844 --> 01:08:45,276
Consider it unfinished business,
my funny little friend.

693
01:08:45,278 --> 01:08:46,976
- Luther?
- Almost there.

694
01:08:46,978 --> 01:08:49,143
You see the end
as clearly as I do, Ethan.

695
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:52,342
Governments the world over
are descending into madness.

696
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:56,409
The Syndicate was created to
tear them down, brick by brick.

697
01:08:56,411 --> 01:08:58,475
The Syndicate was
a pack of murdering cowards.

698
01:08:58,477 --> 01:09:02,342
The Syndicate
was civilization's last hope!

699
01:09:02,344 --> 01:09:06,109
A chance to smash
the old world order.

700
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:08,442
That hope is gone now
because of you

701
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,975
and your pathetic morality.

702
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:14,745
You should have killed me,
Ethan.

703
01:09:17,311 --> 01:09:19,411
The end
you've always feared

704
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,543
is coming.

705
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,445
It's coming!

706
01:09:26,943 --> 01:09:30,078
And the blood
will be on your hands.

707
01:09:32,344 --> 01:09:34,410
The fallout

708
01:09:34,412 --> 01:09:37,812
of all your good intentions.

709
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:45,978
- Time.
- Got it.

710
01:10:10,478 --> 01:10:11,945
Get him up.

711
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,078
You're mine now.

712
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:27,175
You're just
full of surprises, Lark.

713
01:10:27,177 --> 01:10:30,109
Your brother's plan
was bad from the word go.

714
01:10:30,111 --> 01:10:31,942
You'd have lost
all your men

715
01:10:31,944 --> 01:10:33,912
and Lane would've been killed
in the crossfire.

716
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:36,675
I had to improvise.

717
01:10:36,677 --> 01:10:39,409
Well, why not say
that in the first place?

718
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:41,309
Because I don't
trust your people.

719
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:43,744
Especially not your brother.

720
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:50,212
Family. What can you do?

721
01:10:53,178 --> 01:10:55,043
So, where's Lane?

722
01:10:55,045 --> 01:10:57,509
Certainly not at the bottom
of the Seine.

723
01:10:57,511 --> 01:11:00,043
I have him. He's safe.

724
01:11:00,045 --> 01:11:01,978
Where do I meet
the courier?

725
01:11:03,477 --> 01:11:04,877
Let's talk about the woman.

726
01:11:07,177 --> 01:11:08,508
Woman?

727
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,809
She was with you
at the Palais.

728
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:11,575
Zola saw her again today.

729
01:11:11,577 --> 01:11:13,043
She tried to kill Lane.

730
01:11:13,045 --> 01:11:15,511
She had the chance to
kill you, but she didn't.

731
01:11:15,843 --> 01:11:16,845
Why?

732
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,510
We have a past.

733
01:11:23,576 --> 01:11:25,044
It's complicated.

734
01:11:26,943 --> 01:11:30,009
Well, I'll make it
more complicated for you.

735
01:11:30,011 --> 01:11:31,875
My price just went up.

736
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:34,276
Someone killed
four of my men today.

737
01:11:34,278 --> 01:11:35,944
I'm assuming it was her.

738
01:11:42,245 --> 01:11:44,842
I want her, Lark.

739
01:11:44,844 --> 01:11:46,844
And you're gonna
bring her to me.

740
01:11:47,644 --> 01:11:49,609
Otherwise, you don't
meet the courier

741
01:11:49,611 --> 01:11:52,111
and the plutonium goes
to the highest bidder.

742
01:11:53,412 --> 01:11:55,878
I'd hate for her
to come between us.

743
01:12:00,044 --> 01:12:01,577
She's yours.

744
01:12:02,278 --> 01:12:04,777
At the meeting. Not before.

745
01:12:17,178 --> 01:12:18,645
Go to London.

746
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,577
Instructions will follow.

747
01:14:02,877 --> 01:14:06,143
I knew if I followed her,
you'd show up eventually.

748
01:14:06,145 --> 01:14:07,411
Are you okay?

749
01:14:09,643 --> 01:14:10,975
Ilsa, I never
wanted to hurt you.

750
01:14:10,977 --> 01:14:13,246
I know
you have your reasons.

751
01:14:13,977 --> 01:14:15,011
I know.

752
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:20,709
You need to walk away.

753
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:22,179
I can't do that.

754
01:14:23,744 --> 01:14:26,475
You weren't at the Palais
to kill Lark.

755
01:14:26,477 --> 01:14:27,778
No.

756
01:14:29,443 --> 01:14:31,079
You were there
to protect him.

757
01:14:31,611 --> 01:14:32,709
Yes.

758
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:34,745
And you killed him
to protect me.

759
01:14:36,878 --> 01:14:39,345
You wanted Lark
to break Lane out.

760
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:44,876
No. You needed him
to break Lane out.

761
01:14:44,878 --> 01:14:47,179
Because you have to
kill Lane.

762
01:14:48,477 --> 01:14:50,445
Who's making you
do this?

763
01:14:52,144 --> 01:14:53,811
MI6.

764
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:57,508
Why?

765
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:59,274
After we captured him
in London,

766
01:14:59,276 --> 01:15:02,841
they tried to bring Lane home
through diplomatic channels.

767
01:15:02,843 --> 01:15:05,575
But too many countries
want their pound of flesh.

768
01:15:05,577 --> 01:15:07,375
A man like that,
what he's seen,

769
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:09,042
what he knows about
British Intelligence,

770
01:15:09,044 --> 01:15:12,608
they can't have him talking
to a foreign government ever.

771
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,344
That's not what I'm asking.

772
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:16,777
Why did they send you?

773
01:15:17,644 --> 01:15:20,179
This is how
I prove my loyalty.

774
01:15:20,744 --> 01:15:22,409
This is how I come home.

775
01:15:22,411 --> 01:15:24,309
But you were out.

776
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,708
You were free.

777
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:28,142
We are never free.

778
01:15:28,144 --> 01:15:31,076
I spent two years
undercover with Lane.

779
01:15:31,078 --> 01:15:34,045
To them, I'm as much
of a threat as he is.

780
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:38,511
I kill him,
or I never stop running.

781
01:15:40,743 --> 01:15:43,278
Now tell me where he is.

782
01:15:47,777 --> 01:15:49,741
I can't help you.

783
01:15:49,743 --> 01:15:52,511
I will get to him
one way or another.

784
01:15:53,577 --> 01:15:56,179
Please don't make me
go through you.

785
01:16:52,243 --> 01:16:53,275
Yes.

786
01:16:53,277 --> 01:16:55,308
<i>Are you here in London?</i>

787
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,608
<i>I am.</i>

788
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:59,341
Are you ready
to meet the courier?

789
01:16:59,343 --> 01:17:01,808
<i>Yes. Where do I go?</i>

790
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,578
Where would you
like to meet?

791
01:17:41,644 --> 01:17:42,845
Mr. Secretary.

792
01:17:43,777 --> 01:17:45,941
I prayed to God
that it wasn't true.

793
01:17:45,943 --> 01:17:47,676
Well,
in his defense, sir,

794
01:17:47,678 --> 01:17:49,107
if Ethan hadn't intervened,

795
01:17:49,109 --> 01:17:50,441
a great many people
would have been killed.

796
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:52,708
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that
the good people of Paris

797
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:56,244
and the nation of France as a whole
will take that into account.

798
01:17:57,144 --> 01:17:59,077
So what the hell happened?

799
01:18:18,076 --> 01:18:21,208
...at which point, we were
told to come to London

800
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:23,008
and await
further instructions.

801
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:24,477
And what happens now?

802
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:26,377
Now,

803
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:28,942
we meet the Widow
in 20 minutes.

804
01:18:28,944 --> 01:18:30,508
She'll take us
to a courier

805
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:33,742
who'll hand over our missing plutonium
in exchange for Solomon Lane.

806
01:18:33,744 --> 01:18:35,411
Or, in our scenario,

807
01:18:36,576 --> 01:18:37,979
Benji.

808
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:39,709
Jesus.

809
01:18:39,711 --> 01:18:41,141
I'm sorry, what?

810
01:18:41,143 --> 01:18:42,308
Luther and I are gonna
take you to the courier.

811
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:44,308
Walker stays here
and guards the real Lane.

812
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:45,242
Absolutely not.

813
01:18:45,244 --> 01:18:46,742
Wait, wait.
Why do I have to be Lane?

814
01:18:46,744 --> 01:18:48,042
Benji.

815
01:18:48,044 --> 01:18:50,742
Our mission, my mission,
is to recover that plutonium,

816
01:18:50,744 --> 01:18:52,909
and I will do so
at any cost.

817
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:54,708
Even if I have to
trade Lane.

818
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:56,107
The real Lane.

819
01:18:56,109 --> 01:18:58,208
And I will never let him go.

820
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:01,342
When the Apostles realize
that you're playing games,

821
01:19:01,344 --> 01:19:04,075
you'll lose the plutonium.
Again.

822
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:05,842
You let us worry
about the Apostles.

823
01:19:05,844 --> 01:19:08,442
As it stands,
we have a bigger problem.

824
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:10,011
A bigger problem?

825
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:12,074
- Ilsa.
- Ilsa?

826
01:19:12,076 --> 01:19:13,776
Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust Ilsa?

827
01:19:13,778 --> 01:19:15,008
How is she mixed up
in all of this?

828
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,274
She's been ordered to kill Lane.
Direct from MI6.

829
01:19:17,276 --> 01:19:20,876
Look, wait. So that was her
in Paris? On the bike.

830
01:19:20,878 --> 01:19:21,975
Yeah.

831
01:19:21,977 --> 01:19:23,208
Ethan, she tried to kill us!

832
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:24,441
- No, not us. Not us.
- Yeah.

833
01:19:24,443 --> 01:19:26,942
Lane. She tried to kill Lane.
She has no choice.

834
01:19:26,944 --> 01:19:28,107
And she will kill me!

835
01:19:28,109 --> 01:19:29,441
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

836
01:19:29,443 --> 01:19:31,377
Ethan, how exactly are you
not gonna let that happen?

837
01:19:32,677 --> 01:19:35,108
- I'm working on it.
- Oh, he's working on it.

838
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,474
Right now,
we don't have a lot of time.

839
01:19:36,476 --> 01:19:38,108
We have to get ready
for this meeting.

840
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:39,678
The meeting is a trap.

841
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:42,975
The White Widow
is working with the CIA.

842
01:19:42,977 --> 01:19:45,308
She has been
since the beginning.

843
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:48,408
Bargaining for immunity
is her stock-in-trade.

844
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:51,107
Capturing the plutonium, and
the Apostles, and John Lark

845
01:19:51,109 --> 01:19:53,541
buys her a lot of goodwill
with the Americans.

846
01:19:53,543 --> 01:19:55,241
But if Sloane knew
the meeting was a trap,

847
01:19:55,243 --> 01:19:56,676
why didn't she just tell us?

848
01:19:56,678 --> 01:19:58,808
Because, in her mind,
anybody could be John Lark,

849
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:00,611
including one of us.

850
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:04,044
And now her suspicions
are confirmed.

851
01:20:06,244 --> 01:20:07,642
According to that dossier,

852
01:20:07,644 --> 01:20:10,475
a trail of electronic evidence
connects Hunt

853
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:13,475
to the theft of smallpox
from the CDC.

854
01:20:13,477 --> 01:20:16,041
It also links him
to a lengthy correspondence

855
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:18,141
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. Delbruuk.

856
01:20:18,143 --> 01:20:20,675
And, of course, Hunt
handed over the plutonium

857
01:20:20,677 --> 01:20:22,409
to the Apostles himself.

858
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:24,442
Now, those facts,
coupled with

859
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:27,676
a long and incriminating
history of rogue behavior,

860
01:20:27,678 --> 01:20:30,110
corroborate a CIA narrative

861
01:20:30,943 --> 01:20:33,242
that Hunt has snapped.

862
01:20:33,244 --> 01:20:35,409
And that his search for Lark
is nothing but a cover

863
01:20:35,411 --> 01:20:37,478
to hide the fact
that Lark...

864
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:39,545
...is me.

865
01:20:41,544 --> 01:20:43,776
I've got to
hand it to you, Ethan.

866
01:20:43,778 --> 01:20:46,309
Normally, when people refer to
you as your own worst enemy,

867
01:20:46,311 --> 01:20:48,177
it's just a figure of speech.

868
01:20:52,511 --> 01:20:56,107
I'm afraid Sloane's got some
questions for her as well.

869
01:20:56,109 --> 01:20:59,242
The Widow offered her up
at no extra charge.

870
01:20:59,244 --> 01:21:01,545
And where did Sloane
get this information?

871
01:21:02,376 --> 01:21:04,274
She didn't say.

872
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,141
She did, however, grant me the
opportunity to bring you in,

873
01:21:07,143 --> 01:21:09,341
on the condition that
I terminate this mission

874
01:21:09,343 --> 01:21:12,208
and hand over
Solomon Lane personally.

875
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,075
- Sir, you can't do that.
- Hunt.

876
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:16,574
I know Lane. And he has
no intention of going back.

877
01:21:16,576 --> 01:21:18,142
That's why
we're taking him back.

878
01:21:18,144 --> 01:21:21,309
Which means that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

879
01:21:21,311 --> 01:21:22,675
- Ethan...
- Sir, what do you

880
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:23,874
think this is?
A coincidence?

881
01:21:23,876 --> 01:21:25,141
That someone just
happened upon this?

882
01:21:25,143 --> 01:21:27,541
Lane had it sent to her.
He knew how she would react.

883
01:21:27,543 --> 01:21:29,708
Just like he knew
the Widow would turn us in.

884
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:30,974
Don't you see?

885
01:21:30,976 --> 01:21:32,874
This, sir...

886
01:21:32,876 --> 01:21:34,508
This is the trap.

887
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:36,474
- We are being directed.
- Hunt!

888
01:21:36,476 --> 01:21:39,207
There are still two plutonium
cores in the wind!

889
01:21:39,209 --> 01:21:41,644
And you lost them!

890
01:21:43,344 --> 01:21:46,275
In fairness, sir,
we all lost them.

891
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:49,274
Respectfully, sir,
you weren't there.

892
01:21:49,276 --> 01:21:53,074
So making excuses for him
is your full-time job now?

893
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:56,609
Good God, Ethan, don't make this
any harder than it already is.

894
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:59,541
I can no longer protect you,
don't you understand that?

895
01:21:59,543 --> 01:22:02,475
This is as close as you're ever
gonna get to that plutonium.

896
01:22:02,477 --> 01:22:04,409
Sir, you don't
actually believe this.

897
01:22:04,411 --> 01:22:06,676
I believe I've been given
a choice to protect you

898
01:22:06,678 --> 01:22:09,245
or the IMF, which is why
I'm bringing you in.

899
01:22:10,643 --> 01:22:11,974
And if I refuse?

900
01:22:11,976 --> 01:22:14,208
What do you think
he's here for?

901
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,676
You think
he's some observer?

902
01:22:15,678 --> 01:22:17,107
He's an assassin!

903
01:22:17,109 --> 01:22:19,609
Erika Sloane's
number-one plumber.

904
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:22,811
You go rogue, he's
authorized to hunt you down

905
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,678
and kill you.

906
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,840
It's the job.
No hard feelings.

907
01:22:30,842 --> 01:22:32,374
Accept it, Ethan.

908
01:22:32,376 --> 01:22:34,712
You've lost this one.
What's done is done.

909
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:38,974
No, sir. No.

910
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,875
I am not asking you. I
am giving you a direct order.

911
01:22:41,877 --> 01:22:44,578
This mission is terminated.

912
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:46,445
Now!

913
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:50,508
Stickell, he's your friend.

914
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:52,008
Would you please talk
some sense into...

915
01:22:55,076 --> 01:22:57,744
I'm sorry, sir,
but you left me no choice.

916
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:01,741
There's 15 minutes
before we meet the Widow.

917
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,475
You want the plutonium,
we're the only ones

918
01:23:03,477 --> 01:23:05,578
who can get it for you.
You in or out?

919
01:23:07,544 --> 01:23:08,641
In.

920
01:23:08,643 --> 01:23:10,741
- What are you doing?
- Benji needs to get ready.

921
01:23:10,743 --> 01:23:12,908
- No, Ethan...
- There's no time, Luther.

922
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:14,645
I need you to trust me.

923
01:23:31,643 --> 01:23:33,174
You all right?

924
01:23:33,176 --> 01:23:34,841
Yeah, I just

925
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,910
got a bad
feeling about this one.

926
01:24:02,776 --> 01:24:05,042
If you don't hear from us...

927
01:24:05,044 --> 01:24:06,644
I'll do it my way.

928
01:24:10,376 --> 01:24:12,444
Don't take
your eyes off him.

929
01:24:48,676 --> 01:24:50,874
Enough games.
I'm taking you out of here.

930
01:24:50,876 --> 01:24:52,541
Where's Hunt?

931
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:54,940
He's gone to the meeting,
with a copy of you.

932
01:24:54,942 --> 01:24:56,108
Calm down.

933
01:24:56,110 --> 01:24:57,708
Call the Apostles. Warn them.

934
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:59,609
I have no way
of contacting them.

935
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:01,474
For their safety and mine.

936
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:03,042
What I do have
is an extraction team with

937
01:25:03,044 --> 01:25:05,509
satellite overwatch
and a prearranged rendezvous.

938
01:25:05,511 --> 01:25:07,041
They'll know as soon as
we leave the building.

939
01:25:07,043 --> 01:25:09,374
No, I'm staying here.

940
01:25:09,376 --> 01:25:11,478
I haven't finished
with Hunt yet.

941
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:19,442
Why did you have to make this
so fucking complicated?

942
01:25:19,444 --> 01:25:21,275
I don't understand
what you mean.

943
01:25:21,277 --> 01:25:22,907
The deal was simple.

944
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:26,342
I help you frame Hunt,
you give me the plutonium.

945
01:25:26,344 --> 01:25:28,075
You're wasting time.

946
01:25:28,077 --> 01:25:31,640
"There cannot be peace without
first a great suffering.

947
01:25:31,642 --> 01:25:34,874
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

948
01:25:34,876 --> 01:25:35,975
When I wrote those words,

949
01:25:35,977 --> 01:25:40,309
I wasn't referring to your
peace or Hunt's suffering.

950
01:25:40,311 --> 01:25:42,474
The old world order
needs dismantling,

951
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:44,508
and we have the tools
to dismantle it.

952
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:46,242
All you seem to care about

953
01:25:46,244 --> 01:25:49,042
is that Hunt lives
to take the blame.

954
01:25:49,044 --> 01:25:50,840
That's not anarchy.

955
01:25:50,842 --> 01:25:52,342
That's revenge.

956
01:25:52,344 --> 01:25:54,341
Yes, it is.

957
01:25:54,343 --> 01:25:56,807
And when I have
what I want,

958
01:25:56,809 --> 01:25:59,544
the Apostles will give you
the plutonium.

959
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:05,142
Hunt's the only friend
you've got.

960
01:26:05,144 --> 01:26:06,275
You're only alive today

961
01:26:06,277 --> 01:26:08,274
because he didn't have
the guts to kill you.

962
01:26:08,276 --> 01:26:11,108
Sloane was right.
The IMF is Halloween.

963
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:13,511
Nothing but grown men
wearing...

964
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,078
What?

965
01:26:27,576 --> 01:26:30,711
It's just the job.
No hard feelings.

966
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:36,811
I've ruined your day,
haven't I?

967
01:26:38,044 --> 01:26:40,341
Oh!

968
01:26:40,343 --> 01:26:43,408
And you were doing so well
up until then.

969
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:45,641
Now, I think
this one's loaded.

970
01:26:45,643 --> 01:26:47,643
You want to find out?

971
01:27:29,542 --> 01:27:32,477
- So, how'd I do?
- I never had a doubt.

972
01:27:33,877 --> 01:27:36,507
I'm beginning to see why you
guys enjoy this so much.

973
01:27:36,509 --> 01:27:38,375
Hats off, Mr. Secretary.

974
01:27:38,377 --> 01:27:41,078
- The man's a natural.
- Welcome to the team, sir.

975
01:27:42,043 --> 01:27:43,941
You're making a mistake.

976
01:27:43,943 --> 01:27:48,507
No, the mistake was mine when
I saved your life over Paris.

977
01:27:48,509 --> 01:27:51,041
This proves nothing.
I'm playing a role,

978
01:27:51,043 --> 01:27:53,174
just like you are, trying
to recover that plutonium.

979
01:27:53,176 --> 01:27:56,075
That doesn't explain why
you gave Sloane the dossier

980
01:27:56,077 --> 01:27:57,342
and tried to frame Hunt.

981
01:27:57,344 --> 01:27:58,978
He makes a good point,

982
01:27:59,244 --> 01:28:00,708
Lark.

983
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:03,309
He's paranoid. Delusional.

984
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:04,907
Just like the dossier says.

985
01:28:04,909 --> 01:28:06,874
So where did Sloane
get the dossier from?

986
01:28:06,876 --> 01:28:08,741
I have no idea.

987
01:28:08,743 --> 01:28:10,244
<i>I do.</i>

988
01:28:12,842 --> 01:28:14,874
Did you get all that,
Erika?

989
01:28:14,876 --> 01:28:16,242
<i>I did.</i>

990
01:28:16,244 --> 01:28:18,844
<i>I don't appreciate
being used, Walker.</i>

991
01:28:19,509 --> 01:28:23,508
Oops. Bad boy.

992
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:25,242
Where would you
like him delivered?

993
01:28:25,244 --> 01:28:27,177
I'll come to you.

994
01:28:29,575 --> 01:28:31,641
Nobody move!
Nobody move!

995
01:28:31,643 --> 01:28:33,541
Weapons down! Drop 'em!

996
01:28:33,543 --> 01:28:36,408
Hands in the air!
Weapons down!

997
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,507
Drop it! Drop it!

998
01:28:38,509 --> 01:28:39,840
Weapons down!
Right now! You!

999
01:28:39,842 --> 01:28:42,677
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right.

1000
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:45,174
I thought we had a deal.

1001
01:28:45,176 --> 01:28:47,507
<i>We did. And now we don't.</i>

1002
01:28:47,509 --> 01:28:51,409
<i>There is too much at stake here
for me to take any chances.</i>

1003
01:28:51,411 --> 01:28:54,308
I'm bringing you all in,
along with Walker.

1004
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:55,874
The plutonium
is still out there!

1005
01:28:55,876 --> 01:28:58,741
And I don't trust a living
soul in that room to get it.

1006
01:28:58,743 --> 01:29:01,877
<i>We'll sort out
who's who in Washington.</i>

1007
01:29:02,609 --> 01:29:04,574
- Erika!
- Sir?

1008
01:29:04,576 --> 01:29:07,807
It's all right.
Let's just do what she says.

1009
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,610
The only real threats are in
this room, and we have them.

1010
01:29:13,876 --> 01:29:15,143
Do you?

1011
01:29:16,144 --> 01:29:17,211
Go.

1012
01:29:36,743 --> 01:29:38,610
Where the hell is Lane?

1013
01:30:09,143 --> 01:30:10,144
Ethan! Ethan!

1014
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:36,811
First team is down.
Send backup.

1015
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:40,910
Sir!

1016
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:44,245
Oh, no, no, no.
Man down! Man down!

1017
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:48,143
Somebody help!

1018
01:30:57,143 --> 01:30:58,276
Sir.

1019
01:31:02,743 --> 01:31:05,408
Ethan, I tagged Walker,
but he's on the run.

1020
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:06,877
You got to get him.

1021
01:31:11,575 --> 01:31:12,911
Go.

1022
01:31:14,343 --> 01:31:16,011
I'm sorry, sir.

1023
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:19,111
Go.

1024
01:31:29,909 --> 01:31:31,043
Ethan?

1025
01:31:35,276 --> 01:31:36,277
Wait!

1026
01:31:37,842 --> 01:31:39,443
Get that son of a bitch.

1027
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:10,273
Come on, come on, come on.

1028
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:11,477
Yes! I got him.

1029
01:32:22,743 --> 01:32:24,874
I'm sorry.

1030
01:32:24,876 --> 01:32:26,774
Talk to me, Benji.
Where's Walker?

1031
01:32:26,776 --> 01:32:29,274
<i>He's about a quarter
mile west if you turn right.</i>

1032
01:32:29,276 --> 01:32:30,944
To my right?

1033
01:32:33,542 --> 01:32:35,341
I can't do that.

1034
01:32:35,343 --> 01:32:37,340
<i>Why not?</i>

1035
01:32:37,342 --> 01:32:39,007
Because I'm being followed.

1036
01:32:39,009 --> 01:32:41,075
<i>What do you mean? By who?</i>

1037
01:32:41,077 --> 01:32:42,740
How do I know?
CIA, Apostles...

1038
01:32:42,742 --> 01:32:44,407
What difference does it make?

1039
01:32:44,409 --> 01:32:48,077
<i>Okay, okay, just get
out of there and then go right.</i>

1040
01:32:55,275 --> 01:32:57,474
I am terribly sorry.

1041
01:32:57,476 --> 01:32:58,944
Excuse me.

1042
01:33:15,743 --> 01:33:17,377
Why is he running
in circles?

1043
01:33:43,976 --> 01:33:46,910
Okay, you need to cross the street
on your left as soon as you can.

1044
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:53,941
<i>Ethan, did you copy?</i>

1045
01:33:53,943 --> 01:33:56,377
- <i>Left, go left, now!</i>
- I'm working on it.

1046
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,011
<i>Now go across the street
right in front of you.</i>

1047
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:20,142
<i>Ethan, he's getting away from you!
You're gonna have to go faster.</i>

1048
01:34:51,376 --> 01:34:53,477
You're gaining on him!
Go straight.

1049
01:34:55,842 --> 01:34:57,640
Straight?
Keep going straight?

1050
01:34:57,642 --> 01:35:00,043
<i>Go straight, go straight,
straight, straight.</i>

1051
01:35:01,576 --> 01:35:03,308
<i>Okay, now turn right.</i>

1052
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:04,310
Right?

1053
01:35:04,710 --> 01:35:05,908
Now?

1054
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:07,675
- <i>Yes, right!</i>
- Are you sure?

1055
01:35:07,677 --> 01:35:09,011
Yes, I'm...

1056
01:35:09,742 --> 01:35:10,975
No, it's left! Turn left!

1057
01:35:10,977 --> 01:35:13,077
Sorry, I had
the screen-lock on.

1058
01:35:16,743 --> 01:35:18,210
Left.

1059
01:35:21,575 --> 01:35:22,978
Thank you.

1060
01:35:29,276 --> 01:35:32,341
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm jumping out a window!

1061
01:35:32,343 --> 01:35:34,377
What do you mean,
you're jumping out of a...

1062
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:38,573
Oh, sorry. I had it in 2D.

1063
01:35:38,575 --> 01:35:40,109
Good luck.

1064
01:36:13,575 --> 01:36:16,209
At the end of the bridge, turn left.
You've almost got him.

1065
01:36:20,143 --> 01:36:22,240
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, Ethan, get him!

1066
01:36:22,242 --> 01:36:23,444
You're right on top of him!

1067
01:36:38,275 --> 01:36:39,740
That's it, he's right
in front of you!

1068
01:36:39,742 --> 01:36:41,042
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1069
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:21,340
You can't do it, can you? Not
until you get your plutonium.

1070
01:37:21,342 --> 01:37:25,608
No. He still has
plans for you.

1071
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:28,939
You're gonna turn yourself in
and admit you're John Lark,

1072
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:32,473
then watch the old world implode
from your dark little cell.

1073
01:37:32,475 --> 01:37:34,110
And if I don't?

1074
01:37:46,941 --> 01:37:48,577
I'm her
guardian angel, Hunt.

1075
01:37:50,108 --> 01:37:53,107
If I see you again,
she dies.

1076
01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:56,106
If you try to warn her,
she dies.

1077
01:37:56,108 --> 01:37:57,543
Know when you're beat.

1078
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:12,741
These are the designs we recovered
from Dr. Delbruuk's lab in Berlin.

1079
01:39:12,743 --> 01:39:15,074
That's a five-megaton
nuclear device.

1080
01:39:15,076 --> 01:39:16,840
That's greater than
all the explosive energy

1081
01:39:16,842 --> 01:39:17,874
released in World War II.

1082
01:39:17,876 --> 01:39:21,741
To disarm it, normally
we'd cut the fuse wire here.

1083
01:39:21,743 --> 01:39:23,174
What, "normally"?

1084
01:39:23,176 --> 01:39:26,107
Walker and Lane
have two plutonium cores,

1085
01:39:26,109 --> 01:39:27,674
meaning two bombs.

1086
01:39:27,676 --> 01:39:30,207
Yeah. And they're both linked
by a microwave fail-safe

1087
01:39:30,209 --> 01:39:31,906
which is accurate to
within one-tenth of a second.

1088
01:39:31,908 --> 01:39:36,473
Any attempt to defuse one bomb
automatically triggers the other.

1089
01:39:36,475 --> 01:39:39,408
Meaning once armed,
the bombs cannot be disarmed.

1090
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:42,207
The countdown is started
by a remote detonator,

1091
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:44,273
which is also a fail-safe.

1092
01:39:44,275 --> 01:39:46,710
Meaning once
the countdown starts,

1093
01:39:47,242 --> 01:39:48,710
it can't be stopped.

1094
01:39:50,175 --> 01:39:52,842
So the solution
to this is?

1095
01:39:54,841 --> 01:39:56,443
We're working on it.

1096
01:39:57,908 --> 01:39:59,441
So,

1097
01:39:59,443 --> 01:40:02,177
technically, this is
a suicide mission.

1098
01:40:13,076 --> 01:40:14,739
What is it?

1099
01:40:14,741 --> 01:40:17,210
Have a seat. Please.

1100
01:40:21,009 --> 01:40:23,274
In all the years
that I've known Ethan,

1101
01:40:23,276 --> 01:40:26,210
he's only been serious
about two women.

1102
01:40:27,076 --> 01:40:28,876
One was his wife.

1103
01:40:29,677 --> 01:40:31,106
He's married?

1104
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:33,407
No, he was.

1105
01:40:33,409 --> 01:40:35,707
Was?
What happened to her?

1106
01:40:35,709 --> 01:40:37,308
Well, she was taken

1107
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:40,173
by some people
who wanted to get to Ethan.

1108
01:40:40,175 --> 01:40:42,943
It's okay,
he got her back in one piece.

1109
01:40:43,443 --> 01:40:45,277
Then he quit the game.

1110
01:40:46,075 --> 01:40:48,574
They were happy
for a while.

1111
01:40:48,576 --> 01:40:51,675
But every time something
bad happened in the world,

1112
01:40:51,677 --> 01:40:54,408
Ethan would think,
"I should've been there."

1113
01:40:54,410 --> 01:40:57,141
And she would wonder,
"Who's watching the world

1114
01:40:57,143 --> 01:40:59,474
"while Ethan's
watching me?"

1115
01:40:59,476 --> 01:41:02,806
Deep down, they both knew
that someday, somehow,

1116
01:41:02,808 --> 01:41:06,009
something truly terrible
was going to happen

1117
01:41:07,309 --> 01:41:09,675
all because
they were together.

1118
01:41:10,776 --> 01:41:11,843
So...

1119
01:41:14,142 --> 01:41:17,107
- Where is she now?
- She's a ghost.

1120
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:18,773
Good at it, too.

1121
01:41:18,775 --> 01:41:20,574
Taught her myself.

1122
01:41:20,576 --> 01:41:23,140
Every now and then,
she sends up a signal

1123
01:41:23,142 --> 01:41:24,443
to let Ethan know she's safe.

1124
01:41:25,076 --> 01:41:27,010
And that keeps him going.

1125
01:41:28,275 --> 01:41:29,875
Why are you
telling me this?

1126
01:41:31,742 --> 01:41:33,607
Hmm.

1127
01:41:33,609 --> 01:41:37,476
We're in this mess because
Ethan wouldn't let me die.

1128
01:41:39,941 --> 01:41:41,740
He's a good man.

1129
01:41:41,742 --> 01:41:46,640
And he cares about you
more than he can admit.

1130
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:50,577
That's one more worry
than he can handle right now.

1131
01:41:53,043 --> 01:41:55,574
If you care about him,

1132
01:41:55,576 --> 01:41:57,377
you should walk away.

1133
01:42:00,842 --> 01:42:02,207
Luther...

1134
01:42:02,209 --> 01:42:03,810
Is everything all right?

1135
01:42:15,976 --> 01:42:17,743
I'm coming with you.

1136
01:42:26,709 --> 01:42:27,809
I know.

1137
01:42:31,909 --> 01:42:33,410
So how do we find him?

1138
01:42:34,975 --> 01:42:36,640
Microwave transponder.

1139
01:42:36,642 --> 01:42:39,673
Traceable via satellite
anywhere in the world.

1140
01:42:39,675 --> 01:42:41,474
Lane had one of these
in the back of his neck.

1141
01:42:42,543 --> 01:42:43,874
We removed it in Paris.

1142
01:42:43,876 --> 01:42:46,307
At the same time, we put
our own transponder in.

1143
01:42:46,309 --> 01:42:47,577
Got it.

1144
01:42:49,376 --> 01:42:51,706
36-hour
delayed activation,

1145
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:55,041
in case Lane's Apostles
scan him.

1146
01:42:55,043 --> 01:42:57,174
So you planned
on letting him go.

1147
01:42:57,176 --> 01:42:59,440
Not this way, but yes.

1148
01:42:59,442 --> 01:43:01,374
He's gonna lead us
to the plutonium.

1149
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,973
How can you be sure?

1150
01:43:02,975 --> 01:43:06,374
His plan to put me in
prison went to hell.

1151
01:43:06,376 --> 01:43:08,840
Now he's gonna want
me there for the end.

1152
01:43:08,842 --> 01:43:10,572
So when does
this transponder activate?

1153
01:43:10,574 --> 01:43:12,274
I got him. I got him,
I got him, I got him!

1154
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:14,474
He's traveling east
over Europe at 500 knots.

1155
01:43:14,476 --> 01:43:15,606
He's airborne.

1156
01:43:15,608 --> 01:43:17,373
Shall we inform the CIA?

1157
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:18,874
The CIA's been infiltrated.

1158
01:43:18,876 --> 01:43:21,774
I don't trust anybody
outside of this room.

1159
01:43:21,776 --> 01:43:23,710
We're gonna
have to go it alone.

1160
01:43:26,442 --> 01:43:27,642
So where do we go?

1161
01:43:47,741 --> 01:43:49,572
How we doing, Benji?

1162
01:43:49,574 --> 01:43:52,440
If there's a way to defuse
these bombs, I can't find it.

1163
01:43:52,442 --> 01:43:54,842
You'll figure it out.
I know you will.

1164
01:43:56,343 --> 01:43:58,907
Damn. Ethan,
we lost the signal.

1165
01:43:58,909 --> 01:44:00,973
Lane must've
found our transmitter.

1166
01:44:00,975 --> 01:44:04,640
- What's his last position?
- About 30 miles northeast.

1167
01:44:04,642 --> 01:44:06,774
Then that's where
he wants us to go.

1168
01:44:06,776 --> 01:44:08,706
- What's there?
- The Nubra River Valley.

1169
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:10,539
There's only
a medical camp there.

1170
01:44:10,541 --> 01:44:13,308
Humanitarian Aid Overseas.

1171
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:16,110
Why would Lane
target a medical camp?

1172
01:44:16,809 --> 01:44:17,810
Smallpox.

1173
01:44:18,342 --> 01:44:19,840
What?

1174
01:44:19,842 --> 01:44:23,007
Smallpox. The Apostles triggered
a smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.

1175
01:44:23,009 --> 01:44:26,107
Lane must've wanted that camp
there for a reason.

1176
01:44:26,109 --> 01:44:27,806
But what?

1177
01:44:27,808 --> 01:44:30,773
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

1178
01:44:30,775 --> 01:44:34,308
The Nubra River is at the
base of the Siachen Glacier.

1179
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,773
So a nuclear blast there
would irradiate

1180
01:44:35,775 --> 01:44:39,374
the largest natural irrigation
system in the world.

1181
01:44:39,376 --> 01:44:43,508
Fresh water from the border of
China to India and Pakistan.

1182
01:44:44,809 --> 01:44:47,540
They're gonna starve one-third
of the world's population.

1183
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:49,107
"The greater the suffering..."

1184
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:51,341
"...the greater the peace."

1185
01:44:51,343 --> 01:44:54,539
I still don't understand why
Lane wants a medical camp there.

1186
01:44:54,541 --> 01:44:55,939
It doesn't matter.

1187
01:44:55,941 --> 01:44:58,539
All that matters now is we find
a way to defuse those bombs.

1188
01:44:58,541 --> 01:45:00,873
Uh, I think I've found it.

1189
01:45:00,875 --> 01:45:02,174
Maybe. Um...

1190
01:45:02,176 --> 01:45:04,907
Look, there appears to be a flaw
in the bomb's operating system.

1191
01:45:04,909 --> 01:45:07,173
The remote detonator
requires that firing key.

1192
01:45:07,175 --> 01:45:09,639
If we remove that key,
then it should short out

1193
01:45:09,641 --> 01:45:12,307
the fail-safe and allow us
to cut both fuses.

1194
01:45:12,309 --> 01:45:13,939
So one of us
needs to get the detonator

1195
01:45:13,941 --> 01:45:15,006
and remove that key.

1196
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,173
Yeah.

1197
01:45:16,175 --> 01:45:18,976
While the rest of us cut the
fuses on both bombs. Simple.

1198
01:45:19,841 --> 01:45:21,374
Yeah, but...

1199
01:45:21,376 --> 01:45:22,873
But what?

1200
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:25,074
Well, in order
to make this work,

1201
01:45:25,076 --> 01:45:27,506
we can't remove the key
or cut the fuses

1202
01:45:27,508 --> 01:45:30,707
until after
the countdown starts.

1203
01:45:30,709 --> 01:45:32,639
But wait, just so
I've got this clear.

1204
01:45:32,641 --> 01:45:35,307
Our only chance
to safely defuse both bombs

1205
01:45:35,309 --> 01:45:37,209
is to let
the countdown start.

1206
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:40,810
And then remove that key.

1207
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:50,142
Okay.

1208
01:46:08,176 --> 01:46:11,642
Both devices are now
connected to the detonator.

1209
01:46:12,542 --> 01:46:14,573
Fifteen minutes should
give you enough time

1210
01:46:14,575 --> 01:46:16,843
to reach
minimum safe distance.

1211
01:46:19,175 --> 01:46:21,310
My running days are over.

1212
01:46:22,243 --> 01:46:24,643
This is where it ends for me.

1213
01:46:52,976 --> 01:46:55,173
I'm getting signals
all over the place.

1214
01:46:55,175 --> 01:46:58,740
We're at a medical camp. X-ray
machines, CAT scanners,

1215
01:46:58,742 --> 01:47:00,439
radiological signatures
everywhere.

1216
01:47:00,441 --> 01:47:01,907
It's like
a needle in a haystack.

1217
01:47:01,909 --> 01:47:03,940
Process of elimination,
one at a time.

1218
01:47:03,942 --> 01:47:05,840
Let's split up.
Stay on comms.

1219
01:47:16,176 --> 01:47:17,210
Ethan?

1220
01:47:23,108 --> 01:47:24,177
Julia?

1221
01:47:29,075 --> 01:47:30,308
Is that...

1222
01:47:34,509 --> 01:47:35,776
Julia!

1223
01:47:37,508 --> 01:47:38,977
Does he know?

1224
01:47:40,108 --> 01:47:41,674
Hey.

1225
01:47:41,676 --> 01:47:44,207
Uh, this is my husband, Erik.

1226
01:47:44,209 --> 01:47:45,140
Uh, this is...

1227
01:47:45,142 --> 01:47:47,673
Rob. Rob Thorne.
Dr. Rob Thorne.

1228
01:47:47,675 --> 01:47:49,875
- I worked with Julia...
- At Mass General.

1229
01:47:50,508 --> 01:47:51,572
Before New York.

1230
01:47:51,574 --> 01:47:52,973
Oh, you're kidding.

1231
01:47:52,975 --> 01:47:54,907
- What a coincidence!
- I know. I...

1232
01:47:54,909 --> 01:47:56,906
- What brings you all this way?
- I was, uh...

1233
01:47:56,908 --> 01:47:59,241
I was in Turtuk,
not far from here

1234
01:47:59,243 --> 01:48:02,106
and heard help was needed.

1235
01:48:02,108 --> 01:48:03,041
Oh, well,

1236
01:48:03,043 --> 01:48:05,074
actually we're just about
finished here.

1237
01:48:05,076 --> 01:48:08,041
The whole village
is inoculated. But, um...

1238
01:48:08,043 --> 01:48:10,043
What were you doing
out in Turtuk?

1239
01:48:10,575 --> 01:48:12,306
Rob's on vacation.

1240
01:48:12,308 --> 01:48:15,042
No. No, I'm...
I'm working.

1241
01:48:17,341 --> 01:48:19,074
You're a long way from home.

1242
01:48:19,076 --> 01:48:21,376
Yeah, yeah. Thanks to
our guardian angel.

1243
01:48:22,208 --> 01:48:23,240
Guardian?

1244
01:48:23,242 --> 01:48:24,974
Well, yeah. We were
running a field hospital

1245
01:48:24,976 --> 01:48:27,174
outside of Darfur when
the outbreak happened here.

1246
01:48:27,176 --> 01:48:28,272
And here comes
this phone call

1247
01:48:28,274 --> 01:48:30,840
from an anonymous donor,
out of the blue.

1248
01:48:30,842 --> 01:48:32,240
And he says
he's ready to underwrite

1249
01:48:32,242 --> 01:48:35,406
the entire operation.
One condition.

1250
01:48:35,408 --> 01:48:36,973
We run the whole thing.

1251
01:48:36,975 --> 01:48:39,043
Can you believe that?

1252
01:48:40,176 --> 01:48:41,906
I certainly can.

1253
01:48:41,908 --> 01:48:43,639
Yeah. Out of the blue.

1254
01:48:43,641 --> 01:48:45,176
Out of the blue.

1255
01:48:47,575 --> 01:48:49,107
That's quite a full life.

1256
01:48:49,109 --> 01:48:51,306
Yeah, you know, before
Julia, I never traveled.

1257
01:48:51,308 --> 01:48:53,174
<i>I never even left New York.</i>

1258
01:48:53,176 --> 01:48:54,940
<i>Never left the hospital.</i>

1259
01:48:54,942 --> 01:48:57,740
<i>Seven days a week,
dusk till dawn. No vacations.</i>

1260
01:48:57,742 --> 01:48:59,205
Ethan, I think
I found something.

1261
01:48:59,207 --> 01:49:01,506
I was on the fast track
to be Chief of Surgery at 50.

1262
01:49:01,508 --> 01:49:02,874
Heart attack at 55.

1263
01:49:02,876 --> 01:49:06,540
And she convinced me
to let it all go.

1264
01:49:06,542 --> 01:49:08,141
Help where
it's needed most.

1265
01:49:08,143 --> 01:49:10,607
So we've been
on the go ever since,

1266
01:49:10,609 --> 01:49:12,475
and I've never been
more fulfilled.

1267
01:49:13,608 --> 01:49:15,342
I'm happy for you.

1268
01:49:16,408 --> 01:49:17,742
<i>Thank you.</i>

1269
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:21,373
- Well, we should get going.
- Oh.

1270
01:49:21,375 --> 01:49:22,539
We have a lot of
packing to do.

1271
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:24,874
Oh, no, I'll handle that.
You two should catch up.

1272
01:49:24,876 --> 01:49:26,739
Oh, no, I should
get out of your hair.

1273
01:49:26,741 --> 01:49:28,874
Are you kidding?
You should stick around.

1274
01:49:28,876 --> 01:49:31,407
I'm just sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

1275
01:49:31,409 --> 01:49:32,409
Um...

1276
01:49:33,475 --> 01:49:35,973
Tell you what,
we'll pack,

1277
01:49:35,975 --> 01:49:37,974
and why don't we give you
a ride back to Turtuk,

1278
01:49:37,976 --> 01:49:40,940
you two can catch up
in the car? Yeah?

1279
01:49:40,942 --> 01:49:42,543
You're very kind.

1280
01:49:43,474 --> 01:49:45,806
Settled. See you soon.

1281
01:49:47,175 --> 01:49:50,006
It was good to see you.

1282
01:49:50,008 --> 01:49:53,076
I am so sorry, Julia.
I'm so sorry.

1283
01:50:14,309 --> 01:50:16,242
Take both helicopters.

1284
01:50:17,374 --> 01:50:19,109
No one else leaves.

1285
01:50:26,976 --> 01:50:28,910
Careful, careful, careful.

1286
01:50:33,509 --> 01:50:34,573
It's armed.

1287
01:50:34,575 --> 01:50:36,006
But the countdown
hasn't started yet.

1288
01:50:36,008 --> 01:50:37,874
The network signal's strong,
which means the other device

1289
01:50:37,876 --> 01:50:39,639
is close by
and the detonator.

1290
01:50:39,641 --> 01:50:42,108
About half a K
in that direction.

1291
01:50:43,275 --> 01:50:44,610
They're still here.

1292
01:50:45,975 --> 01:50:47,407
Luther, you keep
working on it.

1293
01:50:47,409 --> 01:50:48,508
You two, come with me.

1294
01:50:50,008 --> 01:50:52,806
Oh, sure. I got this.

1295
01:50:52,808 --> 01:50:55,010
Don't worry about old Luther.

1296
01:51:28,842 --> 01:51:30,309
Walker.

1297
01:51:35,841 --> 01:51:37,007
Damn.

1298
01:51:37,009 --> 01:51:38,540
Ethan, the countdown
has started!

1299
01:51:38,542 --> 01:51:39,740
<i>We have 15 minutes.</i>

1300
01:51:39,742 --> 01:51:41,476
Walker has the detonator.

1301
01:51:51,309 --> 01:51:52,408
Come on, come on!

1302
01:51:54,374 --> 01:51:55,974
We have to evacuate
these people.

1303
01:51:55,976 --> 01:51:57,272
There's no time.

1304
01:51:57,274 --> 01:51:59,508
This whole valley's gonna be
incinerated in 15 minutes.

1305
01:52:03,575 --> 01:52:04,873
It's too late!

1306
01:52:04,875 --> 01:52:06,140
No.

1307
01:52:06,142 --> 01:52:07,806
I'm gonna get the detonator.

1308
01:52:07,808 --> 01:52:09,675
- What? How?
- I'll figure it out.

1309
01:52:10,708 --> 01:52:13,706
Find Lane!
Find the other bomb!

1310
01:52:13,708 --> 01:52:16,375
- What the hell is he doing?
- I find it best not to look.

1311
01:52:51,876 --> 01:52:53,105
How we doing, Luther?

1312
01:52:53,107 --> 01:52:55,005
Tripwires everywhere.
I don't have enough hands.

1313
01:52:55,007 --> 01:52:56,239
<i>Just make it happen.</i>

1314
01:52:56,241 --> 01:52:57,340
<i>Where's Ethan?</i>

1315
01:52:57,342 --> 01:52:59,106
He's gone after
the detonator.

1316
01:52:59,108 --> 01:53:00,806
<i>Wait, where's the detonator?</i>

1317
01:53:38,542 --> 01:53:40,272
Luther.

1318
01:53:40,274 --> 01:53:42,639
Julia.
You shouldn't be here.

1319
01:53:42,641 --> 01:53:43,709
Oh, my God.

1320
01:53:44,442 --> 01:53:45,972
Oh, my God.

1321
01:53:45,974 --> 01:53:47,139
Is that what I think it is?

1322
01:53:47,141 --> 01:53:49,039
<i>Luther,
get her out of there!</i>

1323
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:51,072
Where is she gonna go?

1324
01:53:52,508 --> 01:53:53,775
What can I do?

1325
01:53:55,908 --> 01:53:57,874
In the kit, the pliers
with the red grip.

1326
01:53:57,876 --> 01:54:00,906
- <i>Are you insane?</i>
- Mind your business, Benji.

1327
01:54:00,908 --> 01:54:02,710
This is my business!

1328
01:55:45,108 --> 01:55:46,839
<i>Benji, do you copy?</i>

1329
01:55:46,841 --> 01:55:48,706
Ethan! Ethan, where are you?

1330
01:55:48,708 --> 01:55:50,406
I'm in a helicopter
going after Walker.

1331
01:55:50,408 --> 01:55:51,607
<i>Hold on.</i>

1332
01:55:51,609 --> 01:55:53,072
How did you
get in the helicopter?

1333
01:55:53,074 --> 01:55:54,440
What, you can
fly a helicopter?

1334
01:55:54,442 --> 01:55:55,707
Did you say helicopter?

1335
01:55:55,709 --> 01:55:57,972
What the hell are you doing
in a helicopter?

1336
01:55:57,974 --> 01:56:01,040
Just... Hey, hey...
Did you find the other bomb?

1337
01:56:01,042 --> 01:56:02,674
We're still looking,
but finding the bomb

1338
01:56:02,676 --> 01:56:04,640
is not gonna matter
unless we have the detonator.

1339
01:56:04,642 --> 01:56:06,838
I know. I know.
I'll get it. I'll get it!

1340
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,506
<i>Uh, if he's in
another helicopter,</i>

1341
01:56:09,508 --> 01:56:12,073
- how are you gonna get it?
- <i>I'll figure it out.</i>

1342
01:56:12,075 --> 01:56:13,872
You find the bomb,
I'll get the detonator.

1343
01:56:13,874 --> 01:56:15,342
I won't let you down.

1344
01:56:16,375 --> 01:56:18,206
I won't let you down.

1345
01:56:18,208 --> 01:56:20,639
- <i>Be ready.</i>
- Look, Ethan. Ethan!

1346
01:56:20,641 --> 01:56:23,239
Ethan, come in!

1347
01:56:23,241 --> 01:56:25,576
Benji? Benji? Luther?

1348
01:56:26,541 --> 01:56:27,809
Anybody?

1349
01:56:29,175 --> 01:56:30,643
I can do this.
I can do this.

1350
01:56:31,142 --> 01:56:32,273
What do we got here?

1351
01:56:32,275 --> 01:56:33,543
We've got airspeed.

1352
01:56:34,207 --> 01:56:36,073
Airspeed.

1353
01:56:36,075 --> 01:56:38,139
Okay, power. This is power.

1354
01:56:44,509 --> 01:56:47,643
Payload. How do I get rid
of this payload?

1355
01:56:55,907 --> 01:56:57,442
Power.

1356
01:57:11,508 --> 01:57:13,040
Wire strippers.

1357
01:57:13,042 --> 01:57:14,539
I'm a doctor,
not an electrician.

1358
01:57:14,541 --> 01:57:16,607
Sorry, the thing
with the green grip.

1359
01:57:16,609 --> 01:57:18,673
- Got it.
- The wire in my left hand.

1360
01:57:18,675 --> 01:57:20,673
- The black one?
- My left hand.

1361
01:57:20,675 --> 01:57:23,272
- That's your left hand.
- Sorry, the other wire.

1362
01:57:23,274 --> 01:57:24,373
The red one?

1363
01:57:24,375 --> 01:57:25,839
Yes, the red one
in my right hand.

1364
01:57:25,841 --> 01:57:27,173
Just checking.

1365
01:57:27,175 --> 01:57:28,775
Oh, I like her.

1366
01:57:41,875 --> 01:57:43,343
Hold this for me, will you?

1367
01:57:45,941 --> 01:57:46,942
Holy shit!

1368
01:57:51,908 --> 01:57:52,909
Damn it!

1369
01:57:54,175 --> 01:57:55,709
Get up there!

1370
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:05,508
That's right,

1371
01:58:05,841 --> 01:58:06,842
prick.

1372
01:58:15,609 --> 01:58:16,841
Oh, shit!

1373
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:24,742
Son of a bitch.

1374
01:58:27,841 --> 01:58:28,842
All right.

1375
01:58:31,241 --> 01:58:32,442
Whoa!

1376
01:58:37,475 --> 01:58:38,975
Whoa, whoa, too much.
Too much.

1377
01:58:39,907 --> 01:58:41,738
Oh, shit!

1378
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:43,939
<i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>

1379
01:58:43,941 --> 01:58:48,272
<i>Terrain. Terrain. Pull up.</i>

1380
01:58:48,274 --> 01:58:50,340
- <i>Pull up.</i>
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

1381
01:58:50,342 --> 01:58:52,409
<i>Terrain. Terrain.</i>

1382
01:59:10,108 --> 01:59:11,472
Benji, I'm not
finding anything.

1383
01:59:11,474 --> 01:59:13,506
I think we're looking
in the wrong place.

1384
01:59:13,508 --> 01:59:14,806
Signatures everywhere.

1385
01:59:14,808 --> 01:59:16,206
This is the perfect place
to hide it.

1386
01:59:16,208 --> 01:59:19,576
That's the point. I know Lane.
If we're looking here,

1387
01:59:20,375 --> 01:59:22,439
it's because he wants us to.

1388
01:59:24,941 --> 01:59:26,340
I'm heading to the village.

1389
01:59:26,342 --> 01:59:28,205
Just wait for me,
all right?

1390
01:59:30,641 --> 01:59:31,540
Uh...

1391
01:59:31,542 --> 01:59:33,475
Ilsa, I think
I've found something.

1392
01:59:37,408 --> 01:59:40,873
Cut this wire right here.

1393
01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:44,307
Turn that screw
counterclockwise, very slowly.

1394
01:59:44,309 --> 01:59:45,509
Got it.

1395
01:59:48,075 --> 01:59:49,142
So...

1396
01:59:51,142 --> 01:59:52,539
How is he?

1397
01:59:52,541 --> 01:59:55,108
Oh, you know.
Same old Ethan.

1398
02:00:04,309 --> 02:00:05,509
Jesus!

1399
02:00:09,409 --> 02:00:11,106
Oh, shit!

1400
02:00:11,108 --> 02:00:12,742
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1401
02:00:20,875 --> 02:00:23,672
- Benji, I see Lane.
- What? Where?

1402
02:00:23,674 --> 02:00:25,439
<i>He's in a house
at the edge of the village.</i>

1403
02:00:25,441 --> 02:00:27,407
All right,
just wait for me, okay?

1404
02:00:27,409 --> 02:00:28,874
<i>Ilsa, wait for me!</i>

1405
02:00:39,074 --> 02:00:40,339
No.

1406
02:00:44,974 --> 02:00:46,574
Nuclear bomb.

1407
02:00:57,707 --> 02:00:58,709
Damn it!

1408
02:01:41,774 --> 02:01:43,842
Benji, I found the other bomb.

1409
02:01:44,342 --> 02:01:45,705
Ilsa, where are you?

1410
02:01:45,707 --> 02:01:47,239
I'm in a house...

1411
02:02:09,674 --> 02:02:12,272
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

1412
02:02:12,274 --> 02:02:13,806
You're out of your mind!

1413
02:02:13,808 --> 02:02:15,675
I don't know
what's down there.

1414
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:21,641
Pull up, pull up!

1415
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:33,438
This crazy son of a bitch
is trying to ram us!

1416
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:34,908
Go!

1417
02:02:52,074 --> 02:02:53,471
Shit!

1418
02:02:53,473 --> 02:02:54,872
Benji, come in.

1419
02:02:54,874 --> 02:02:56,072
We're almost at the fuse.

1420
02:02:56,074 --> 02:02:57,941
We need to find
that other bomb now.

1421
02:02:59,508 --> 02:03:01,705
Did you just say
"other bomb"?

1422
02:03:01,707 --> 02:03:04,639
- Benji, do you read me?
- I'm working on it!

1423
02:03:04,641 --> 02:03:06,309
Ilsa, where are you?

1424
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:26,605
You can't stop it.

1425
02:03:26,607 --> 02:03:29,773
Do you understand?
There's nothing he can do.

1426
02:03:29,775 --> 02:03:31,006
When the clock runs out,

1427
02:03:31,008 --> 02:03:33,009
Ethan Hunt
will lose everything

1428
02:03:34,142 --> 02:03:35,674
and everyone

1429
02:03:36,608 --> 02:03:38,675
he ever cared about.

1430
02:03:39,708 --> 02:03:41,273
Ilsa!

1431
02:03:41,275 --> 02:03:42,372
Benji!

1432
02:03:42,374 --> 02:03:43,506
Benji!

1433
02:03:43,508 --> 02:03:45,308
Ilsa, where are you?

1434
02:03:46,573 --> 02:03:48,308
You don't want to see this.

1435
02:03:50,108 --> 02:03:51,372
Benji!

1436
02:03:51,374 --> 02:03:53,639
- Ilsa!
- Benji!

1437
02:03:53,641 --> 02:03:55,609
Benji! Benji, stop!

1438
02:04:24,874 --> 02:04:25,975
Benji!

1439
02:04:51,708 --> 02:04:55,308
Oh, no, no, no!

1440
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:34,209
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1441
02:05:37,573 --> 02:05:38,806
No, no.
Not when I'm this close.

1442
02:05:38,808 --> 02:05:40,909
Not when I'm this close.
Come on, come on!

1443
02:07:27,341 --> 02:07:28,571
Thank you.

1444
02:07:28,573 --> 02:07:30,271
Tie him up.

1445
02:08:33,206 --> 02:08:35,507
Why won't you just die?

1446
02:08:57,775 --> 02:08:59,942
There's nothing else
you can do.

1447
02:09:01,574 --> 02:09:03,508
Go be with your husband.

1448
02:09:04,708 --> 02:09:06,175
Luther...

1449
02:09:06,574 --> 02:09:07,642
Go.

1450
02:09:20,774 --> 02:09:22,239
Benji, where are you?

1451
02:09:22,241 --> 02:09:24,171
Okay, Luther, we're inside.
Tell us what to do.

1452
02:09:24,173 --> 02:09:26,772
<i>You should see the red wire
attached to the motherboard.</i>

1453
02:09:26,774 --> 02:09:27,939
Yeah.

1454
02:09:27,941 --> 02:09:29,039
<i>You need to cut that
and the green wire</i>

1455
02:09:29,041 --> 02:09:31,306
<i>next to it simultaneously.</i>

1456
02:09:31,308 --> 02:09:32,938
- Okay, ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

1457
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:34,004
- Set?
- Mmm-hmm.

1458
02:09:34,006 --> 02:09:36,339
Cut.

1459
02:09:36,341 --> 02:09:39,071
I told you.
It can't be stopped.

1460
02:09:39,073 --> 02:09:41,275
There's nothing you can do.

1461
02:12:59,241 --> 02:13:02,639
Benji, listen. Turn the screw
counterclockwise.

1462
02:13:02,641 --> 02:13:04,539
Yep.

1463
02:13:04,541 --> 02:13:06,238
<i>Remove that panel
and you'll see</i>

1464
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:08,205
<i>the power and ground wires
for the fuse.</i>

1465
02:13:08,207 --> 02:13:09,271
Got it.

1466
02:13:09,273 --> 02:13:11,171
When the time comes,
cut the green wire.

1467
02:13:11,173 --> 02:13:13,004
<i>Do not cut it yet.</i>

1468
02:13:13,006 --> 02:13:14,241
Okay. We copy.

1469
02:13:19,441 --> 02:13:22,175
Ethan, if you can hear me,
we're ready to make the cut.

1470
02:13:22,874 --> 02:13:24,471
<i>Ethan, come in.</i>

1471
02:13:24,473 --> 02:13:27,738
Benji, how do we know
if he's got the key?

1472
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:29,238
<i>He'll get it.</i>

1473
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:31,773
- Yeah, but how do we know?
- He'll get it done!

1474
02:13:37,473 --> 02:13:39,673
We're out of time. We just
have to hope he has it.

1475
02:13:39,675 --> 02:13:42,005
- Okay, we're ready.
- <i>At two seconds we cut.</i>

1476
02:13:42,007 --> 02:13:43,539
Wait, wait, wait! Why two?
Why not one?

1477
02:13:43,541 --> 02:13:44,937
You want to cut it that close?

1478
02:13:44,939 --> 02:13:46,204
It's a second
we'll never get back.

1479
02:13:46,206 --> 02:13:47,371
Can we make
a decision on this?

1480
02:13:47,373 --> 02:13:48,872
All right, all right!
We'll do it on one.

1481
02:13:48,874 --> 02:13:49,938
Cutting on one?

1482
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:50,941
Yes, one.
All right, stand by.

1483
02:13:53,241 --> 02:13:54,904
Three...

1484
02:13:54,906 --> 02:13:57,004
- Two...
- One.

1485
02:13:57,006 --> 02:13:58,441
Now!

1486
02:14:36,274 --> 02:14:38,008
Okay.

1487
02:14:48,807 --> 02:14:50,342
My man.

1488
02:15:37,107 --> 02:15:38,575
<i>Ethan?</i>

1489
02:15:40,874 --> 02:15:42,008
<i>Ethan?</i>

1490
02:15:43,041 --> 02:15:44,674
Can you hear me?

1491
02:15:48,341 --> 02:15:49,941
Can you hear me?

1492
02:15:53,474 --> 02:15:55,474
No.
Don't, don't, don't.

1493
02:15:56,207 --> 02:15:57,804
Don't try to move.

1494
02:15:57,806 --> 02:16:00,508
Don't move.
You're pretty banged up.

1495
02:16:03,273 --> 02:16:05,005
You're a lucky man.

1496
02:16:05,007 --> 02:16:07,805
It's a miracle that crash
didn't kill you, Dr. Thorne.

1497
02:16:07,807 --> 02:16:09,471
If your friend didn't find you
an hour later,

1498
02:16:09,473 --> 02:16:11,172
you would've died of exposure.

1499
02:16:11,174 --> 02:16:13,075
- My friends?
- Yeah.

1500
02:16:15,572 --> 02:16:18,372
She got here
not long after you left.

1501
02:16:18,374 --> 02:16:21,306
Right in front of half
the Indian Army.

1502
02:16:21,308 --> 02:16:23,908
Can you give us
a few minutes, please?

1503
02:16:25,839 --> 02:16:27,907
See you later, Doc.

1504
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:35,707
Julia...

1505
02:16:36,974 --> 02:16:38,705
I'm sorry.

1506
02:16:38,707 --> 02:16:40,704
There's no reason
to be sorry.

1507
02:16:40,706 --> 02:16:41,905
No.

1508
02:16:41,907 --> 02:16:43,641
I'm sorry

1509
02:16:44,839 --> 02:16:46,841
for everything. I...

1510
02:16:48,341 --> 02:16:49,807
Look at me.

1511
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:52,371
Look at me.

1512
02:16:52,373 --> 02:16:54,107
Look at my life.

1513
02:16:55,639 --> 02:16:59,305
I love what I do,
and I never would have

1514
02:16:59,307 --> 02:17:00,908
found this
if I hadn't met you.

1515
02:17:01,839 --> 02:17:04,904
And everything that happened,

1516
02:17:04,906 --> 02:17:08,139
it taught me who I am.
It showed me

1517
02:17:08,141 --> 02:17:10,740
what I am capable of,
and I...

1518
02:17:11,274 --> 02:17:13,537
I am a survivor.

1519
02:17:13,539 --> 02:17:15,474
But what happened here,

1520
02:17:16,572 --> 02:17:18,570
- it was my...
- Nothing happened.

1521
02:17:18,572 --> 02:17:20,773
Because you were here.

1522
02:17:22,673 --> 02:17:26,140
And I sleep soundly at night
knowing you always will be.

1523
02:17:35,374 --> 02:17:37,039
You're happy?

1524
02:17:37,041 --> 02:17:38,442
Very.

1525
02:17:41,374 --> 02:17:43,908
I'm exactly where I should be.

1526
02:17:46,174 --> 02:17:47,908
And so are you.

1527
02:18:26,806 --> 02:18:28,573
<i>Per your request,</i>

1528
02:18:29,907 --> 02:18:34,041
<i>I'm handing Solomon Lane
back to MI6.</i>

1529
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:40,541
<i>Through a broker, of course.</i>

1530
02:18:42,473 --> 02:18:45,673
<i>Part of our
ongoing arrangement.</i>

1531
02:18:50,407 --> 02:18:53,004
<i>After what happened in Paris,</i>

1532
02:18:53,006 --> 02:18:55,940
<i>we prefer
to keep a low profile.</i>

1533
02:18:57,540 --> 02:19:02,471
<i>And that closes your friend's
account with British Intelligence.</i>

1534
02:19:04,439 --> 02:19:06,938
The ribs. Watch the ribs.

1535
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:11,205
<i>I understand now
why Hunley believed in you.</i>

1536
02:19:11,207 --> 02:19:14,204
<i>The world needs the IMF.</i>

1537
02:19:14,206 --> 02:19:16,604
<i>We need people like you</i>

1538
02:19:16,606 --> 02:19:18,208
<i>who care about the one life</i>

1539
02:19:19,207 --> 02:19:22,541
<i>as much as they care about
the millions.</i>

1540
02:19:24,141 --> 02:19:25,604
<i>That way</i>

1541
02:19:25,606 --> 02:19:27,540
<i>I never have to.</i>

1542
02:19:28,207 --> 02:19:29,608
You okay?

1543
02:19:30,539 --> 02:19:32,672
You've never looked better.

1544
02:19:32,674 --> 02:19:34,674
Don't. Please.

1545
02:19:35,440 --> 02:19:36,874
How close were we?

1546
02:19:39,572 --> 02:19:40,773
The usual.

1547
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:46,707
The usual?

1548
02:19:48,373 --> 02:19:50,470
Please don't make me laugh.
