00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,751
Not so fun now, is it,

560
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,544
you cold-blooded bastard.

561
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:34,631
Heads up!

562
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,096
Fuck with the Blade,

563
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,181
you're gonna get cut. (KISSES)

564
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,149
(GRUNTS)

565
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:58,947
(GRUNTING)

566
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,085
You move like the Shirai Ryu,

567
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,920
but they are dead.

568
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,423
Who are you? What do you want?

569
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,508
SCORPION: Revenge.

570
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,973
Tell me, Lin Kuei scum.

571
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,142
Where is Sub-Zero?

572
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,560
(STRAINING)

573
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:34,441
Die knowing I will kill

574
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:37,944
every last member of the Lin Kuei
on this island.

575
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:41,448
Every last one.

576
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,042
(BOTH GRUNTING)

577
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:03,094
You are Raiden's chosen one? (CHUCKLES)

578
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:06,222
No wonder your realm
has lost so many tournaments.

579
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,650
I do not wish to hurt you.

580
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,360
KITANA: Spare me your pity.

581
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,999
LIU KANG: Do not get up.

582
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,253
I take no pleasure
in hurting such a worthy foe.

583
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,546
But know this.

584
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,131
I will do whatever it takes

585
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:42,675
to defend Earthrealm
and win this tournament.

586
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,803
KITANA: Then you are a fool.

587
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:48,223
Shao Kahn cannot be defeated.

588
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,058
He will take your world

589
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,144
and you will bow your knee
like countless others before you.

590
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,437
I promise you,

591
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,106
I will never bow before that madman.

592
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,152
KITANA: I yield.

593
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,908
What makes you so sure you will win?

594
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:10,453
Because I have something
no one in Outworld has.

595
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:12,664
- What?
- Hope.

596
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,183
SHANG TSUNG: Impressive, Raiden.

597
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,520
Your warriors have made it further
than I would've thought.

598
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:38,606
They are strong in spirit, Shang Tsung.

599
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,192
You will not win today.

600
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,028
I have heard such promises before.

601
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:49,158
Thankfully, after Goro kills
whomever makes it to the final round,

602
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,703
I will not have to hear them again.

603
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,830
And Quan Chi,

604
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,249
your warrior from Netherrealm,

605
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,002
he's proving to be quite formidable.

606
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:01,129
For the glory of Outworld,

607
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:04,215
I serve at the pleasure of Shao Kahn.

608
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,593
Indeed.

609
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,344
You won't succeed.

610
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,598
No matter how many foes you put between
the Earthrealm fighters

611
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,558
and your champion,

612
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,393
they will make it to the end.

613
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:16,728
Oh.

614
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,230
I'm glad you feel that way.

615
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,108
Surely, you know of the Black Dragon.

616
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,528
It seems that several
have made it onto the island

617
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:28,072
with orders to kill
your Earthrealm friends.

618
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:30,575
How dare you!

619
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:34,037
Are you accusing me
of something, Lord Raiden?

620
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,873
You brought them here
to interfere with the tournament.

621
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,583
And break the rules?

622
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,918
Even I am not so bold

623
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,546
as to anger the Elder Gods
in such a way.

624
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:47,133
You will not succeed, Shang Tsung.

625
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,761
We'll know soon enough, won't we?

626
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:03,900
CAGE: Ah.

627
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,694
What I wouldn't give
for a frozen margarita.

628
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,576
- Hey! Really?
- (YELPS)

629
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,537
I know. Look at this shirt.
It's ridiculous.

630
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:17,997
I'm glad to see you, though.

631
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:20,458
Okay. You won't believe this,

632
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,669
but this isn't some sort of movie.

633
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,045
This is the real deal.

634
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,381
Maybe a snuff film or something.
I don't know.

635
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,132
But I had to fight some, uh...

636
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,884
I don't even know what it was.

637
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:31,427
I barely got out alive.

638
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,429
I can believe that.

639
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,556
Listen, I'll get you out of here,

640
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,016
but we'll need to stick together.

641
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,519
First rule of combat
is to secure our position.

642
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,605
Let's find somewhere to hole up
and then we can start recon.

643
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,774
Find out where we are,
what we're up against.

644
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:45,983
LIU KANG: A sound strategy.

645
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,736
You both made it. Good.

646
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,655
I fear it's only gonna
get harder from here.

647
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,782
Whoa. (STAMMERS) Wait.
What's gonna get harder?

648
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,743
I just fought a walking pair of teeth
on the side of a mountain.

649
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,412
I'm not Tom Cruise, you know.

650
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:58,538
I act.

651
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,249
I leave that stunt shit
for the stunt people.

652
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,835
Listen, sweetheart.
We should get out of here--

653
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,421
(GROANS) My dick!

654
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,965
Fuck balls! No one touches me
without permission.

655
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,633
- You got it?
- Got it.

656
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,135
You said you knew where we were?

657
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:13,094
I do.

658
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,637
But it will be dark soon.

659
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,931
We need to make camp. Rest.

660
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,141
Agreed.

661
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,059
- (METAL CLANGING)
- (MEN GRUNTING AND GROANING)

662
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:25,565
No, no. Don't wait for me. I'm fine.

663
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:28,693
Let me just pee out some blood first.
(GROANS)

664
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:31,821

(MAN WHIMPERING)

666
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,460
What the fuck?

667
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,589
I think I'm gonna be sick.

668
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:51,966
(VOMITING)

669
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,344
Stay behind me.

670
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,554
I'll take care of this.

671
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,431
What is this, 1950?

672
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,057
Step back, Bruce Lee.

673
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:01,517
Bring it, bitch.

674
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:02,435
CAGE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

675
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,520
Everyone just chillax. Okay?

676
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,355
No one needs to fight anyone,

677
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:09,192
especially some guy that
just went psycho on a bunch of, uh...

678
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,569
Black Dragon. Mercenaries.

679
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,489
Assassins. Bad guys.

680
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,907
Yeah. Those guys.

681
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,033
We have to continue.

682
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:19,076
Once Mortal Kombat has been declared,

683
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,203
it must be finished.

684
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,830
Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

685
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:24,791
- Did you?
- Nope.

686
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,752
Well, what about you, Mr...

687
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,295
SCORPION: Scorpion.

688
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,172
Oh. It's catchy. I like that.

689
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:32,590
Did you declare Mortal Kombat?

690
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,845
Good. Good. Great.
Then no one needs to die. Sheesh.

691
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,016
Now, who's hungry?

692
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,149
LIU KANG: I know you didn't
believe it before,

693
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:51,484
but it's all true.

694
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:54,153
The Elder Gods,
the tournament, everything.

695
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,780
Emperor Shao Kahn

696
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:58,157
has won nine previous
Mortal Kombat tournaments.

697
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,450
If he wins a tenth...

698
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,452
Then what?

699
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:03,913
SCORPION: Then you all die.

700
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,499
Great. Just great.

701
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:10,336
Yeah. Okay.
Monsters, magic, this can't be real.

702
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,380
Somebody must've slipped something
into my drink.

703
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,631
I'm hallucinating.

704
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,757
Get a grip, Johnny.

705
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,635
Whatever this is, it's real.

706
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,137
There's no use sitting around
and whining about it.

707
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,557
If what Liu Kang says is true,

708
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,141
then the whole world is in trouble,

709
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,726
and we have to stop it.

710
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,062
If I can get to a radio,

711
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,022
the communications array,

712
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,482
I can call in reinforcements.

713
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:34,068
Turn this island
into the next cautionary tale.

714
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,113
RAIDEN: If only it were that easy.

715
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:39,407
- LIU KANG: Lord Raiden.
- SCORPION: You.

716
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,243
SONYA: What do you mean,
"If only it were that easy"?

717
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,787
Do you know what
a Hellfire missile can do?

718
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,331
I'm sure it's very powerful on Earth,

719
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,251
but we are not on Earth.

720
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,630
This island lives
in a place between realms,

721
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,967
a place set aside specifically
for the tournament.

722
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,052
Uh-huh. Sure. Sounds great.

723
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:02,722
So, if what Liu Kang says is true,

724
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,975
then you're really
some sort of god, right?

725
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,977
I have been given many names.

726
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,520
CAGE: Well, shoot, Buddha.

727
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,272
Snap your fingers, get us home.

728
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,025
I am done with
psycho monsters and bad food.

729
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,109
And by the way,

730
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,237
I'll never complain about
doing a sequel again in my life.

731
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,322
He cannot.

732
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:22,408
Lord Raiden is forbidden from
interfering in the tournament.

733
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,036
It is a bargain he made
to save Earthrealm

734
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,787
from being taken over eons ago.

735
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:29,248
Well, that's... That's insane.

736
