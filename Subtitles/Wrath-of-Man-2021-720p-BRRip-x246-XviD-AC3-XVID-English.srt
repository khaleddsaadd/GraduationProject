1
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,366
Copy that! Over and out.

2
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,230
Gotta get these hinges greased, Mick.
Come on.

3
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,147
The grease isn't the problem.

4
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,725
It's the hinge.

5
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,981
This is a creaky old dinosaur.

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,734
This old girl should've
been retired ten years ago.

7
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,659
Yeah. Well, they should've
retired me ten years ago.

8
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,452
Not you, Charlie. You're in your prime.

9
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,872
I should know because we're the same age

10
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,074
and I'm in my prime.

11
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,703
Hey, is that coffee still hot?

12
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,038
Yeah, it's hot enough.

13
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,043
All right, then.

14
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,249
Do me a favor.

15
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,630
You ever thought about
buying a coffee maker?

16
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:40,840
Coffee maker?

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,301
You know, one that's
got that milk froster thing.

18
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,229
Oh, yeah. Frother. I got you.
Yeah

19
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,432
that way you can, uh... thanks.

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,608
You know, make your own cappuccino.

21
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,185
Oh, goddamn.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,521
I thought you said this coffee was hot.

23
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,981
What is this?

24
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,361
Dude, it's typical. What's our time?

25
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,865
I don't know,
but this truck needs to get moving.

26
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,571
The game's gonna be starting soon.

27
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,702
The freeway's gonna be backed up.

28
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,499
Oh, fuck! Shit! Reverse!

29
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,829
- The fuck are we supposed to do now?
- You know what to do, follow protocol.

30
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,627
What the fuck!

31
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,238
- Dispatch, come in!
- They're cutting the fucking door!

32
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,880
We're being hit by armed assailants.
Repeat, armed robbery in progress.

33
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,009
Coming in!

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,840
They're cutting the door.

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,323
Hands up! Hands up in the air.

36
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,650
Let's go, move it.

37
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,989
Get the fuck out.
Keep your hands away from your weapons.

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,915
Hands away from your weapons.

39
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,834
Come on, let's go.

40
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,164
- Fortico 1377, alarm raised...
- Move!

41
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,258
Fuck me.

42
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,254
- Alarm registered.
- Clear!

43
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,382
Do what we say
and you fucking live.

44
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,433
Two black-and-whites en route.
Approximately two minutes away.

45
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,601
Two minutes dispatched.
Incoming eta two minutes.

46
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,688
Two minutes.

47
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,667
Bravo, can you hear me?

48
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,431
- Fuck!
- Please respond.

49
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,768
What the fuck is going on out there?

50
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,696
He shot two fucking guards, Elvis.
He shot two fucking guards.

51
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,261
- Number one, are we good?
- Bravo, come in.

52
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,845
- Are we good, number one?
- We're good.

53
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,656
What's happening there?

54
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,988
Number one just
shot a fucking kid.

55
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,363
He shot a fucking...

56
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,827
- What do you see?
- Incoming. Incoming.

57
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,941
- Elvis, what's the play?
- Incoming!

58
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,734
- I'm on him.
- Take the legs.

59
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,089
Fuck!

60
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,293
- Oh, my god. What the fuck?
- I said the fucking legs.

61
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,720
Okay, we've got one minute.
Let's go.

62
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,469
- Come on!
- Exit west. We gotta go. Come on!

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,845
Let's go! Let's go!

64
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:08,232
Fortico security specialize in armed guard
cash pick-up trucks and deliveries across L.A.

65
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,278
Our clients are made up
of large scale retail department stores,

66
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,786
marijuana dispensaries, cash vaults,
casinos, private banks.

67
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,788
Can I get another one”?
Thank you.

68
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,494
We're not federal.

69
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,545
We're essentially middle men.

70
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,248
Hundreds of millions
shifting through here every week.

71
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,880
We got 12 trucks,
two or three guards in each.

72
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,087
A driver, a messenger and a guard.

73
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,264
Each moving up to 15 mil a day
and sometimes more,

74
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,763
which can attract unwanted attention.

75
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,186
I won't lie, it can be dangerous.

76
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,140
Which is why we train you properly
and pay the premium rates.

77
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,649
So we can all sleep better at night.

78
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,772
Thanks.

79
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,819
Now your background checks
came back fine.

80
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,694
And your reference from
orange delta security was impressive.

81
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,365
That was a good company.

82
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,034
I'm sorry to hear it went bust.

83
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,824
Family? Married

84
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,534
- divorced.
- No one else?

85
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,627
No

86
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,044
Good. Stay focused. I like it.

87
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,757
But just so you know,
we lost a couple of guards a while back.

88
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,085
Killed on the job, a civilian too.

89
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,386
A fucking tragedy.

90
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,098
And they still haven't
found the scum who did it.

91
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,391
And that's why we've upped our game.

92
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,140
Sixty hours of firearms training.

93
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,230
Patrick?

94
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,685
Are you Patrick hill?

95
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,062
Yeah, no, please, don't get up.
Good to meet you.

96
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,145
Let's see, hill, hill.

97
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,197
H. I'm gonna call you h,
if that's okay.

98
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,236
They call me bullet.

99
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,240
Which is ironic
because I certainly don't move like one.

100
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,367
- Are you ready for target practice?
- Ready.

101
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,414
I saw you had your pistol license already.

102
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,873
So this is the pre-assignment
training course.

103
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,249
We got eight hours together.

104
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,501
Popping cans off walls and the like.

105
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,924
You need to hit the 70% pass Mark.

106
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,219
There's some fitness which, by the looks
of it, shouldn't be a problem for you.

107
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,547
We just need to see
how you are under pressure.

108
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,264
Shall we get started?

109
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,592
Whatever you say, bullet.

110
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,659
That's quite enough of that.

111
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,544
Been a while, huh?

112
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,422
Little practice, I'm sure you'll get there.

113
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:53,731
Whoa, whoa, whoa, too far, too far.
Pull it up a little. Pull it up.

114
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,286
I ook at that: 70%.

115
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,121
You just slipped in.

116
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,952
Any less, we'd be doing this again.

117
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,252
You won't be joining a formula 1 team
any time soon,

118
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,707
but you'll do for this job.

119
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,751
Let's get you suited.

120
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,216
How many we've got coming?

121
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,933
In that case I'll get three pounds of ribs
and a bucket of wings for the kids.

122
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,135
Cough up, bullet.

123
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,561
- Dude, I'm on the phone.
- I don't care. Thirty dollars.

124
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,688
- How much?
- Thirty bucks.

125
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,061
- Wait for it. Wait for it.
- Change.

126
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,108
- Suplex!
- I want that money.

127
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,733
- There you go, buddy.
- Give me the dollar, dollar.

128
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,654
- Forty-one...
- Thank you.

129
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,448
Forty-two's not gonna beat me.

130
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,446
- Fuck off, Dana.
- Come on.

131
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,528
You're not supposed to be here, anyway.

132
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,239
No, I think it's you who's
in the wrong change room, Stuart.

133
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,245
Come on, let's
look lively, people.

134
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,043
Chop-chop, show me your money.

135
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,588
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a new addition.

136
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,508
- Here you go, Shirley.
- May I introduce h.

137
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,298
Yeah, she'll do.

138
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,549
Put 'em down, Dana.

139
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,011
Come on. I'll show you your locker.

140
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,141
This one is yours.

141
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,513
You good? Yeah.

142
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,688
Why, don't I look it?

143
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,353
No, buddy, you look like
a shrink-wrapped Rolls-Royce

144
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,904
in contrast to this car crash.

145
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,733
Meet hollow Bob and boy sweat Dave.

146
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,159
You look like you could do
some pull ups.

147
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,987
I put a 50 on you beating boy sweat here.

148
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,539
What's the matter with him?
He looks good for it.

149
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,288
Yeah, that's what boy sweat thinks.
But he's also a cock.

150
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,207
- Who's a cock?
- You're a cock, Dave.

151
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,334
I reckon our man here
could pull yours right off.

152
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,217
He looks like he could handle a cock.
Yeah small hands.

153
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,386
Makes me very popular
and you look good.

154
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,558
What's that?

155
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,593
I said, uh...

156
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,263
I'm sure you'd win.

157
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,983
At what?

158
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,856
The pull ups.

159
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,524
Oh, charming.

160
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,234
One of yours?

161
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,735
I've been looking for him.

162
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,307
- I'll put him back in the collection.
- Glad I could help.

163
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,111
You're making friends already.

164
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,162
It's worth getting to know Dave.

165
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,992
He's quite entertaining
in an unintentional kind of way.

166
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,453
Yeah. He once killed a hamster
because he squeezed it too tight.

167
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,005
He can't write
without sticking his tongue out.

168
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,424
This is your temporary side arm.

169
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,001
Just till you get your own.

170
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,007
I need you to love it, respect it,

171
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,055
and bring it back in one piece.

172
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,554
They want us back in one piece too?

173
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,431
- Do you have a problem?
- I don't know, do 1?

174
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,518
What happens if we're pulling pistols
in a machine-gun fight?

175
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,772
Then you retort
with a positive mental attitude.

176
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,611
- Name?
- He's h.

177
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:40,574
H.

178
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,572
I ike the bomb or like Jesus h.

179
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,784
Well, if you can mushroom cloud
or walk on water,

180
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,706
what you worried about machine guns for?

181
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,204
It's the rock star's first day.

182
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,631
All right. Lucky I got a soft drop then.

183
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,710
Try to keep your piece strapped,
like he should have done on prom night.

184
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,465
You're just unhappy I'm happy.

185
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,639
Yeah, only man I know that married
the first woman he banged.

186
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,591
You're a cynical old dog, supe.

187
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,847
But I still got plenty of bitches.

188
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,019
Of course he does.

189
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,363
Oh, that's nice.

190
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,488
- Who's your pal?
- I'll explain later.

191
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,618
Jesus Christ,
at least try to look busy, Shirley.

192
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,535
You're gonna love who your new partner is.

193
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,211
Just tell me it ain't the limey.

194
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,959
Commando doof himself

195
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,050
fuck!

196
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,044
Boy sweat, you'll be happy to hear
that h is replacing sticky John.

197
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,754
- Thank you, Stuart.
- Got it, bullet.

198
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,135
Stay out from under my feet
and we'll get along just fine.

199
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,723
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this job can be?

200
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:53,974
Somewhat do, yeah.

201
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,272
No, you have no idea.

202
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,226
We ain't the predators, we're the prey.

203
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,949
Ooh.

204
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,741
Boy sweat's up front.
You jump in there with him.

205
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,943
Whatever you say, boss.

206
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,262
Hear about the guards that
were murdered? It happened down there.

207
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,165
Come on, Dave, it's his first day.

208
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,670
What? He needs to hear this.

209
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,173
Don't engage.
He'll forget what he said in a moment.

210
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,015
I heard.

211
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,590
It's a tragedy.

212
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,679
What you didn't hear is that I was
meant to be driving the truck that day.

213
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,482
Why wasn't you?

214
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,481
- I was sick.
- Hungover.

215
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,564
Sick! All holes.

216
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,614
The last thing I needed
was the feds in my face

217
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,738
trying to make out if I was involved.

218
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,740
Lucky you had a strong alibi.

219
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,071
Fuck you, bullet.

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,410
He was staying at his mom's.

221
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,326
She knows how I like my eggs.

222
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,214
This is a $2 million pick up
for bank of the us.

223
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,262
Dave will stay in the truck.
H, you're coming with me.

224
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,056
You get to meet the lovely ladies
who work the tills.

225
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,008
Just be wary of hot Betty.

226
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,845
If you're lucky,
she'll only take your fucking arm off.

227
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,108
Godfrey, h. H, Godfrey.

228
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,981
- H.
- Godfrey.

229
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,437
X marks the spot.

230
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,740
Godfrey, as always, a pleasure.

231
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,323
I like the way you handle that cart.

232
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,075
Where did you learn that technique?

233
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,202
Spent a lot of time in supermarkets.

234
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,824
Shopping.

235
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,878
I can picture it now.

236
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,673
A paragon of modern man on a wild sojourn,

237
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,254
stalking down the aisles,
hunting for pop-tarts.

238
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,555
Pop-tarts are not really my poison, bullet.

239
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:58,979
I prefer to lose myself in the dizzy food
coma of synthetic cheese and impossible meat.

240
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,181
What has the world come to?

241
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,392
A direct line of evolution.

242
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,273
From paleolithic man...

243
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,147
To a diabetic house husband.

244
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,991
- Harsh.
- But true.

245
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,660
How'd your boy do”?

246
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,078
Did he survive the hostile territory
of hot Betty and the menopausal milfs?

247
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,088
Did you make poo-poo
or is your diaper still clean?

248
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,460
He did just fine.

249
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,964
Hot Betty almost slid off her seat.

250
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,090
So there's juice in the old raisin yet.

251
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,232
Wakey, wakey, sticky.

252
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,609
2411. Clear to proceed.

253
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,951
Pull in slowly this time, boy sweat.

254
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,255
Base, this is gamma. Reporting back.

255
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,755
Copy that, gamma.

256
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,970
Who's that boyfriend of yours?

257
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,390
They always gotta see the driver
and messenger,

258
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,093
otherwise, you ain't getting in.

259
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,683
Okay, gamma. You're clear.

260
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,568
At least your boy didn't fuck that up.

261
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,858
I still prefer sticky John.

262
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,440
- Everyone prefers sticky John.
- Mm_

263
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,116
You're gonna love him, Dave.

264
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,196
He's got that exotic European thing
working for him.

265
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,030
It'll take you a while to dial in.

266
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,911
Hasn't taken me very long.

267
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,915
I don't care what you guys think.
That man's a dark horse.

268
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,462
What do you mean by that?

269
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,416
That cat's overqualified for this game.
He's got history.

270
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,512
We're all overqualified for this game.
And we all got history.

271
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,059
Beer and pool? Your first day is over.

272
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,311
It's a tradition.

273
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,684
Sure. Give me two minutes.

274
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:44,206
- Point of the game is to get the ball in the hole.
- Point of a woman is to shut the fuck up, Dana.

275
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,438
Well, that Ivy league education
is really working for you, boy sweat.

276
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,356
Pretty soon, you'll all be working for me.

277
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,308
Power is in this big head here.

278
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,316
It's definitely not in your little head,
or you still blaming the beer?

279
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,357
Yo, you gonna take your shot or what?

280
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,444
At least I'll still be here next week
to take a shot.

281
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,995
What's that supposed to mean?

282
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,868
He's already got your road job.

283
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,915
Word around the pool table is

284
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,334
boss has eyes for the new boy.

285
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,413
What, flat-footed limey? I'd shit him.

286
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,027
Maybe you should say that to his face.

287
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,502
Maybe I will.

288
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,757
I spy with my little eye that I smell fear.

289
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,508
That doesn't make any sense.

290
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,224
Hey, John.

291
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,473
You're an idiot

292
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,347
fucking assholes.

293
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,350
Here comes the walk of shame.

294
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,979
Yo, action man, can I buy you a beer?

295
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,279
No

296
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,863
Sorry...

297
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,036
You mind?

298
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,244
So where did you work before then?

299
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,548
Orange delta security, Europe.

300
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,717
Jolly exciting, was it, mate?

301
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,507
Yeah, spectacular.

302
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,512
You ain't much for talking,
are you, Mary poppins?

303
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,895
Uh, no, I can talk.
I just don't want to talk to you.

304
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,067
Let me buy you a beer.

305
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,652
Just make sure you drink it over there.

306
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,835
Anything else?

307
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,293
I gotta give it to you, h.

308
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,675
You're a real social magician.

309
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,215
First, you take his job...

310
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,185
And then you make him cry in his beer.

311
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,122
What is taking him so long?

312
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,795
It's a 10-grand drop. He should have
been back five minutes ago.

313
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,756
Hey, bullet, what's taking you so long?

314
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,968
Bullet, unless you found
some beautiful, blue-eyed latino boy,

315
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,303
you should be back by now.

316
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,107
Fucking fuck!

317
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,656
Don't fucking look at me...

318
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,497
Dave.

319
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,704
They're gonna fucking kill me.

320
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,585
Now listen to me, ladies,

321
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:05,215
if you want to see your girlfriend again,
you'll do exactly as I say.

322
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,967
Um

323
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,093
Um, I have to call this... no, uh...

324
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,016
There's a protocol for this.
We have to drive away.

325
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,187
Sorry?

326
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,062
They don't want his 10 grand.
They don't want his 10 grand.

327
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:22,113
The money is in the truck. We have
2.5 million dollars. If we take it away,

328
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,438
they're not gonna hurt him.

329
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,532
Dave

330
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:29,201
you need to pull yourself together.
You need to reconsider this.

331
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,075
Reconsider? That's why they have
the fucking policy!

332
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,828
You don't want to do this?
Get out of the truck now.

333
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,080
But we're not leaving him behind.

334
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,628
He's one of us. It's only money.

335
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,338
In short, I'm getting him back.

336
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:50,716
Stop fucking around.
You have one minute before she dies.

337
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,852
Now turn the key and drive

338
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,181
and I will tell you when to stop.

339
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,936
Are you gonna drive or you getting out?

340
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:01,778
Oh, shit.

341
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,483
This is such a bad idea

342
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,711
Take the next left.

343
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,181
Now stop the truck.

344
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,700
All right. All right.

345
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,369
We got your fucking friend,
he don't mean shit to us.

346
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,869
They're serious.

347
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,456
Shut the fuck up.

348
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,414
Open the fucking doors

349
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,500
and pick up the money
and throw it in the flatbed.

350
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,302
You open up, they're just gonna kill us
and take the money, anyway.

351
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,932
Dave, you just worry about putting
your asshole back in your asshole.

352
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,225
And leave this to me.

353
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,771
Fuck!

354
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,697
- Fuck.
- This guy's fucking around.

355
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,645
- He's throwing bags on the floor.
- Goddamn it.

356
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,125
Listen up, fuckboy.

357
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,999
I said throw the money
in the fucking flatbed.

358
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,129
Try to get clever again and old boy's
getting a face full of shit.

359
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,550
Don't be fucking slick.

360
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,254
Just do what he says.
These guys are fucking serious.

361
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,974
Get it in the truck next time,
you fuck nut.

362
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,065
Sorry, pal.

363
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,683
Fuck!

364
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:09,978
Fuck

365
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,692
put the gun down... take the money!

366
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,161
Please, stop!

367
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,581
Give them the fucking money!
Are you fucking insane?

368
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,999
Fuck!

369
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,219
Bullet! Bullet!

370
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,020
Who is this fucking lunatic?

371
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,790
Fuck!

372
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,508
Who do you work for?

373
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,299
Suck my fucking dick.

374
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,099
What did you say?

375
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,805
I said suck my fucking dick.

376
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,135
Suck your own dick.

377
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,408
You all right, Dave?

378
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,155
Did you make poo-poo?

379
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,257
Thank you.

380
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,386
Last but not least, Mr. hill.

381
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,598
Well, you're all
sticking to the same story.

382
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,807
That's what happened.

383
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,319
What I don't understand
is how you managed to take down six men

384
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,896
without even so much as a scratch.

385
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,606
You gotta admit it's impressive.

386
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,237
He saved his partner's life.

387
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,110
What about your firearms experience”?

388
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:25,414
Your shooting
was unambiguously precise yet...

389
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,042
Your training scores
were decidedly average.

390
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,165
Barely even passed.

391
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,039
Kill or be killed.

392
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,298
Seemed to focus the mind.

393
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,433
All right. Well, there's something else.

394
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,475
I'd like you to take a look at this video.

395
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:52,103
This is security footage from the raid
on the fortico cash truck before,

396
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,025
when the guards were killed.

397
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,855
- I can't watch this again.
- Step outside, by all means.

398
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,193
We just want you to let us know
if you think there's any connection

399
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,279
between this robbery
and the men you encountered before.

400
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,459
You all right to keep watching?

401
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,555
Yeah

402
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,470
I'm all right.

403
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,768
Mr. hill?

404
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,679
Anything ringing a bell?

405
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,192
Mr. hill?

406
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,989
Any connection, Mr. hill? No.

407
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,079
You sure?

408
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,127
I'm sure.

409
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,755
All right, Mr. hill,
we'll pick this up another day.

410
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,969
- Are we done”?
- Yeah, we'll be in touch.

411
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,881
Visit the therapist. Rest up.

412
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,764
Thank you, Mr. hill.

413
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,767
Patrick, can I have a word?

414
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,356
We have a policy.

415
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,406
The shrinks advise that employees
be taken off the front line

416
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:27,611
for a month following violent incidents,
and longer if lives are lost.

417
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,032
So we're gonna transfer you to desk duty

418
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,787
in case of PTSD.

419
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,209
Do I look disturbed?

420
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,505
No, you don't, but then
these things take time to manifest,

421
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,627
to percolate.

422
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,834
It's with your best interests at heart.

423
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,636
You hired me to do a job, did a job.

424
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,472
No, we hired you to move money.

425
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,765
You hired me to protect money.

426
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,217
Mr. hill”?

427
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,472
Hey, I'm Blake halls. I own fortico.

428
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,024
I wanted to congratulate you for yesterday
and to thank you in person.

429
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,601
What you did deserves credit.

430
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,111
You're a real hero,

431
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,939
and that's not wasted on me.

432
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,282
Take the rest of the day off

433
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,328
while Terry and I discuss
your promising future.

434
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,705
Terry, we need that guy in the field.

435
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,538
If we'd had him last year,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

436
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,293
He's exactly what we need.

437
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,421
And the publicity for fortico
has been very positive.

438
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,629
Plus, have you heard the crews talking?
They're inspired.

439
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,930
So don't punish him, promote him.

440
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,930
- Well?
- Yes, it was him.

441
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:40,438
It had him written all over it.
Question is, what was he doing there?

442
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,145
I think we know
what he was doing there, boss.

443
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,903
Clever fucking you, Hubbard.
It's called sarcasm.

444
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,200
What do you want us to do?

445
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,243
Not a fucking thing, let the painter paint.

446
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,366
Do you have any idea
what would happen to us

447
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,790
if anyone found out that
we let the fox in the fucking hen house?

448
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,707
The bureau's been trying
to catch this man for 25 years.

449
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,164
We're just gonna let him
sit on hundreds of millions?

450
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,124
Money doesn't mean a thing to him.

451
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,130
Listen, there's a reason
why I chose you two,

452
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,052
because we have the same priorities.

453
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,923
Now listen to me very carefully.

454
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,635
As far as you're concerned, he's just
a reqular guard doing a good job.

455
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,936
Do we understand each other?

456
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,188
I oud and clear.

457
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,477
"Let the painter paint"?

458
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,738
What the fuck does that look like?

459
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,335
Fortico personnel files.

460
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,008
Pictures of Dana's family.

461
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:52,473
And... the autopsy report.

462
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,673
Show me your fucking ass.
Face down on the ground right now.

463
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,342
Face on the fucking ground.

464
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,184
Seems you can walk on water after all.

465
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,522
Keep up the good work, soldier.

466
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,822
Nice one, man.

467
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,860
Be my guest.

468
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,666
All right, brother.

469
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,992
Good job, man. Let's go.

470
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,047
Jump on up, big boy.

471
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,052
We should get takeout from the blossom.

472
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,598
The noodle soup at Neptune's is the bomb.

473
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,024
I prefer the blossom.

474
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,070
All right.

475
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,697
You're gonna call the order in?

476
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,783
I'm busy.

477
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,533
I can see that.

478
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,735
Who's this joker?

479
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,570
What the hell is going on?

480
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,031
- Move! Get the fuck back.
- Get back!

481
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,539
- Reverse. Reverse.
- I can't fucking see.

482
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,964
Gamma to base, we have a code red.

483
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,262
Gamma, this is base.
What's your location, over?

484
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,259
Take cover!

485
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,136
Chinatown, Broadway and hill.

486
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,969
Repeat, code red in progress.

487
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,271
Just follow procedures.
Stay in the truck, over.

488
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,225
- Get out of the fucking truck!
- Police were dispatched.

489
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,686
Come on, get out of there.
Get out of the truck.

490
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,691
They're coming.

491
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,192
On the ground.

492
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,240
Open the fucking doors.

493
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:18,986
(Set down!

494
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,831
(Set down!

495
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,746
Get down on the ground.

496
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,541
You got three seconds.

497
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,304
So let me get this straight.

498
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,800
They just walked away.

499
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,725
Get in the fucking Van! Move it!

500
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,847
Let's fucking go now!

501
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,361
Doors were open.

502
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,235
What the fuck was it, Mike?

503
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,784
It was the...

504
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,247
Yeah

505
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,739
turned back around and left

506
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,705
no, I'm sorry.

507
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:12,005
But what Terry is trying to say
is that you're a legend.

508
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,959
And if you keep this up,
you won't just be employee of the month.

509
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,510
You'll have your own calendar
and merchandise.

510
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,843
Now get out there and keep crushing it.

511
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,471
Why are you so cynical?

512
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,061
I'm starting to think he's a psychopath.

513
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,523
I hear h is for hero.

514
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,245
Drink?

515
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,510
It doesn't feel right.

516
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,310
It was as if he recognized h.

517
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,520
Like he saw a dark spirit.

518
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,363
What are you saying?

519
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,319
I don't know what I'm saying.

520
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,069
He's not a cop.

521
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,580
Doesn't smell like a cop.

522
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,167
But if he's not a cop, what is he?

523
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,046
He's a dark fucking spirit.

524
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,682
Put that on.

525
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,175
Meet me next door.

526
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,892
I told you that first day.

527
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,098
I don't trust him.

528
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,198
What the hell are you doing?

529
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,285
Sit down.

530
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,710
I'm not sitting down.
I want to go back to bed.

531
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,489
Dana, sit down.

532
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,440
You've got ten seconds to explain this.

533
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,484
I'm not telling you anything.

534
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,653
Dana, it's very important...

535
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,113
That you take my inquiry seriously.

536
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,238
I take it very seriously
that you think you can interrogate me

537
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,819
in my own fucking house.

538
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,994
Jesus. Fuck! Jesus Christ.
It's my savings, all right?

539
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,999
The fuck has it got to do with you?

540
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,090
You're not listening.

541
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,876
Fuck. All right. Okay, please, stop.

542
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,886
Sit down.

543
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,610
I found it.

544
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,438
Okay, it was being signed for one day
by the staff at crown liquor.

545
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,397
They missed it, it was in the trolley.

546
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,778
- You stole it?
- Yeah, I fucking stole it.

547
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,826
It's 125,000.

548
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,076
It's my retirement fund.

549
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,699
Working with anyone on the inside?

550
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,543
No, what the fuck...?

551
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:42,006
Think carefully
before you answer the question.

552
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,888
No

553
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,930
The retirement fund is yours.

554
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,568
But if it comes to light that you're not
telling me something that I need to know...

555
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:09,318
I want you to understand
how resourceful and serious I am.

556
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,494
On the table's a picture of your parents.

557
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,531
Had it taken last week.

558
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,422
I know who you love.

559
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,128
And I do bear a grudge.

560
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,301
Do we understand each other?

561
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,682
(00d.

562
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,338
They're saying that climate change
is a natural phenomenon

563
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,023
rather than an artificial phenomenon.

564
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,276
So how do you explain global warming,
the ice caps melting?

565
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,154
Well, what melts up there
reforms down there.

566
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,370
Know why they call the arctic "the arctic,”
and the antarctic "the antarctic"?

567
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,031
No, Dougie, I don't.

568
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,534
That's why I pay for you
to go to good schools.

569
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,370
Arktos means "bear" in Greek,
ant means "without."

570
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:05,707
Hence, antarktos: "Without bears."

571
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,297
Up with, down without.

572
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,551
Good news for ice cubes,
bad news for polar bears.

573
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,350
- What time's the game start?
- Six-thirty. We've got ages.

574
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,395
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know, grab some food?

575
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,895
Sure. Hello?

576
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,193
- Hi, sir.
- What is it, Mike?

577
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,030
Dougie, go get a coat, will you?

578
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,116
It's not gonna rain.

579
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,369
Dougie, coat.

580
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,417
- But why?
- Because I'm your dad.

581
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,921
And I said so.

582
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,545
(Set someone else to do it.

583
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,843
I can't, boss, there is no one else.
It's gotta be you.

584
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,795
Joe, two fucking minutes.

585
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,097
I'm with my son, Mike.

586
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,094
You know Dougie is over here on holiday

587
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,800
and it's the only time I get to see him.

588
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,852
It's your fucking job, you do it.

589
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,725
Understood.

590
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,773
Brendan was on it but he got knocked off
his bike by a drunk driver.

591
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,980
Make sure the boss knows it's not my fault.

592
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,074
It's a drunk driver.

593
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,195
He's with the police now
making a statement,

594
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,777
otherwise he'd find a way to be there.
There is no one else.

595
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,035
I'm out of town,
mogqgy's surveilling the depot.

596
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,579
I'd help if I could, Mike,

597
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,747
but my eyeballs are on the depot.

598
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,838
Then postpone it.

599
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,666
We can do that if you want but it's
gonna set us back three months of recon.

600
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,045
We need to know the route.

601
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,219
If they turn left or right,
that's all you have to witness.

602
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:37,219
And there's no danger to it at all.
You can stand back a thousand yards.

603
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,266
Didn't you put trackers on the truck?

604
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,433
They scan the trucks every time
they return to the base.

605
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,640
We can't do it digitally.
We've gotta put eyes on it.

606
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,770
And boss.

607
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,653
I'm tracking on your phone right now,

608
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,355
you're blocks away, 10 minutes.

609
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,066
And I repeat, no danger.

610
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,038
Dad.

611
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,246
- Happy?
- Happy.

612
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,464
I'm starving, fancy a burrito?

613
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,882
You don't even like burritos.

614
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,013
I know, but I'm starving.

615
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:19,935
Sure.

616
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,897
I'll be two minutes, okay?

617
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,936
- Keep the doors locked, don't go anywhere.
- All right.

618
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,540
- Yes, sir?
- Two burritos, please, sir.

619
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,708
You got it.

620
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:47,796
Go ahead, Mike.

621
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:54,050
I can see you there.
Now, is that some gates on your left side?

622
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,556
Yeah

623
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,928
now in a minute,
those said gates are gonna open.

624
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,805
And that said minute is how.

625
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:14,279
All I need to know from you
is if that truck is turning left or right.

626
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:20,944
Right turn.

627
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,991
You know, make your own cappuccino.

628
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,537
Oh, goddamn. Who is this?

629
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,815
Yo! Out of the
fucking car, come on.

630
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,360
Don't fucking look at me!
Out of the fucking car.

631
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,732
All right, Mike. Is my day done?

632
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,863
You're call
has been forwarded to...

633
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:05,492
Do you hear me? Out of the fucking car!
Face down, come on!

634
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,417
Show me your fucking hands!
Face down on the ground right now.

635
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,541
- There you go.
- I do what we say and you'll live.

636
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,293
Face to the fucking ground.

637
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,083
Thank you.

638
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,476
Fuck!

639
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,437
Dougie?

640
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,211
Try not to move too quickly.

641
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,378
You're in a hospital.

642
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,586
You were in an accident, you were shot at.

643
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,669
Six bullets removed.

644
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,929
Three operations.

645
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,715
Two lifesaving.

646
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,258
You lost a fifth of your blood.

647
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,974
You've got a warrior spirit.

648
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,020
What about my son?

649
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,441
Dougie?

650
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,495
My beautiful boy.

651
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,844
And now he's gone.

652
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,183
He looked up to you.

653
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,476
Was obsessed with you.

654
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,116
It wasn't my work, Jane.

655
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,866
You killed our son.

656
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,340
And still you have nothing to say.

657
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:05,569
You are a cold, cold cunt.

658
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,939
My condolences for your loss.

659
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,444
Before you ask,
we have no leads on this thing.

660
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,364
Which is kind of strange
for a job this big.

661
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,161
Somebody knows something.

662
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,707
Somebody always knows something.

663
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,127
It's just I'm not allowed
to ask the hard questions.

664
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,136
Here's the shit list

665
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,342
knock yourself out.

666
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,891
Need any of them to live?

667
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,398
I don't miss anyone
that your boys have buried so far.

668
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,112
Then you need to let me do this my way.

669
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,996
I can do in two weeks

670
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,909
what you only wish
you could do in 20 years.

671
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:48,088
If their names are on that list,
you can do your worst.

672
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,552
Just be mindful
that I can only look confused for so long.

673
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,589
The floor is yours.

674
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,534
Brendan.

675
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,368
You need to quit that.

676
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,242
I can hardly breathe here.

677
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,657
It wasn't your fault.

678
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,663
It was a drunk driver.

679
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,538
It's easy for you to say.

680
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,666
It's his son, moggy. His only son.

681
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,250
Hey, we all fucked up.

682
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,506
So let's accept the responsibility
and not turn on each other in there.

683
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:41,263
Brendan, retain your dignity.

684
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,023
It's a fucking tragedy, boss.

685
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:55,323
We all love Dougie.
And our sympathies run deep.

686
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,115
It's more my fault than anyone's.

687
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,489
And we'll do anything
to find who's responsible.

688
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,870
I need to know who pulled the trigger.

689
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,579
I need a face.

690
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,257
Of course.

691
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,046
And we've been on nothing else
trying to get answers.

692
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,760
It's not any of the usual suspects.

693
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,475
You're gonna tell us what we want to know.

694
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,434
This is your last chance.

695
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,691
The tree has been shook.

696
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,277
And it's been shook hard.

697
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:37,825
I want a name.

698
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,779
Anyone with a skill set, with a form.

699
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,281
We've run out of names.

700
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:49,665
We've deployed large amounts of time,
money and effort

701
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,211
in the search for justice.

702
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,166
It was a long list.

703
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,130
Not good enough.

704
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,461
Understood.

705
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,388
But we've scorched earth

706
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,136
no, it's not understood.

707
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,854
You started by saying
you'd do anything.

708
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,647
But what I'm hearing is

709
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,142
you think you've done everything.

710
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,820
Understood.

711
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,405
I I hear the train a comin' j

712
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,788

719
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,487
j on down to San antone j

720
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,864
j when I was just a baby j

721
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,076
j my mama told me, "son" j

722
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,537
- what the fuck?
- Make a sound and you're dead.

723
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,297
J "always be a good boy j

724
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,593
j don't ever play with guns”

725
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:28,468
all right, Jerome, what do you think?
It's getting late. We all got places to go.

726
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,178
Why don't you save us a lot of time
and you a lot of trouble

727
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,809
and tell us what we need to know?

728
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,518
Trouble”? You motherfuckers got no idea
how much trouble you're in.

729
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,522
Do you know who the fuck I am?

730
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,321
Yeah, I know exactly who you are
and that's why you're here.

731
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,195
So I can see it's gonna be a long night.
Let's get started.

732
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,155
Bag him.

733
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,578
No! Fuck you all!

734
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,535
J it's rolling round the bend j

735
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,419
> and I ain't seen the sunshine j

736

j my mama told me, "son j

739
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,731
j always be a good boy j

740
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,194
j don't ever play with guns”

741
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,278
All right, take it off.

742
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,502
I don't think he knows anything.

743
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,510
We'll see about that.

744
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:02,144
I hear you're a tough
lad and a hard worker.

745
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,532
Good for you.

746
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,222
But you're still gonna give me a name.

747
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,117
If not for your life, for hers.

748
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,536
What the fuck! Don't touch her!

749
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,167
I said don't touch her.
Don't fucking touch her!

750
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,919
- Leave her out of this!
- Bag her.

751
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,125
- No.
- No!

752
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,262
All right! The only fucking name.

753
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,264
Jackson brothers.

754
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,155
If it's anyone, it's them.

755
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:06,463
Home invasions,
he's talked about these cash trucks too.

756
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:10,091
But you did not hear this from me,
and if you did...

757
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,517
Kill me now.

758
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:25,065
Give him 200 grand. Leave
the keys in the car.

759
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,378
Pass me the water.

760
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:46,884
You all right?

761
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,721
No, I'm not.

762
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,638
It's a shit show.

763
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,845
Fucking reptiles.

764
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,976
There's kids involved.

765
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,108
Got a feeling I'm gonna
be cleaning up all day.

766
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,503
Mike.

767
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,886
Here you go, sweetheart. Drink some water.

768
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,260
There's a good qirl.

769
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,793
How much is in the pot?

770
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,430
I'd say 2.5.

771
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:01,258
So what do you think?

772
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,355
I think

773
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:06,806
it isn't them.

774
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,065
You've got to tell the boss.

775
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:25,742
They're filthy fucks.
And they have done trucks.

776
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,873
But they ain't our men.
That job was above them.

777
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:31,834
They're more about the smash and grab.

778
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,250
Looks like there's two and a half mil,
which they confessed to.

779
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,345
But, uh...

780
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,962
What do you want me to do?

781
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,468
Don't want you to do anything, mogqgy.

782
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:03,866
How old are these girls?

783
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,161
Not old enough.

784
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,128
Give the girls the cash.

785
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,015
And let 'em go.

786
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,787
Can I speak candidly, boss?

787
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,423
I don't think we should do this again.

788
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,555
Understandably, you're...

789
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,347
You're not in your right
mind just now, and...

790
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,222
You need a break.

791
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,560
But we can't continue
to handle business this way.

792
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,773
Otherwise, some fuckers are gonna come
for us before we can get to them.

793
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,869
The truth? We need a different approach.

794
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:31,913
It's gotta be an inside job.

795
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:35,954
You're right, Mike.

796
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:39,966
I shouldn't have got you involved.

797
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,889
I'm gonna go back to London for a while.

798
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:55,599
- Patrick.
- Patrick. I'm a brit, not a Mick.

799
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:56,774
So your mom's Irish.

800
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:00,737
Usual fare, this time you're
Patrick hill from lewisham.

801
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:05,405
You've got a driver's license, passport,
IRS papers with a full tax history,

802
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,826
and medical records.

803
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,154
All your criminal checks are clean.

804
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,991
You've got 25 years' worth of employment.

805
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,163
With references working in Europe

806
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,745
and the same for the
previous addresses too.

807
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:22,335
Your employment history has been inserted
into the delta orange security system.

808
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:26,843
So, should anyone check,
you've worked there for 11 years.

809
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,174
You even finished college,

810
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:32,602
and have held the same gym membership
since 2011.

811
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:37,482
As requested, you have your pistol license.

812
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,527
And finally, the hotel has been arranged.

813
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,313
It's another brand new youl.

814
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:45,736
Kirsty, one more thing.

815
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,027
Give me a copy of the coroner's report.

816
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,288
Are you sure that's a good idea?
“Just do it.

817
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,462
And your reference from orange delta
security was impressive.

818
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,006
- Family?
- Married. Divorced.

819
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:05,005
Anyone else? No.

820
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,967
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. hill.

821
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,644
You ain't much for talking, are you,
Mary poppins?

822
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,221
Let me buy you a beer.

823
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,065
Just make sure you drink it over there.

824
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,408
The autopsy report.

825
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:32,954
Show me your fucking hands!
Face down, on the ground, right now!

826
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,082
Face to the fucking ground!

827
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:44,703
How you holding up, Sam?

828
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,468
What's to say?

829
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,092
Wake up late, watch TV.

830
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,095
Drink a beer and watch more TV.

831
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,975
Maybe convince ma to give me a few bucks
so I can buy more beer.

832
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,353
Watch TV until I'm drunk
enough to fall asleep.

833
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,355
Did I mention I watch TV?

834
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,439
You're awfully quiet, Brad.

835
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,323
I'm not quiet.

836
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,495
I'm bored.

837
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,659
- Bored of what?
- Of not fucking working.

838
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:19,827
I'm built for combat, not daytime TV.

839
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:24,748
The afghanis treated us
better than our own.

840
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,084
I wish I was back in the unit.

841
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,929
Boredom is more dangerous than bullets.

842
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,142
Give me an enemy I can fucking see.

843
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,356
How about you, are you working, boss?

844
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:44,768
Still part-time at the mall.

845
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,404
Costing more than I'm making.
If it wasn't for Amy's parents,

846
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:50,524
we'd be on the street.

847
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:54,987
Seems like Carlos is the only one
who landed on his feet with the oil tycoon.

848
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,993
So I'm there from 6:00 in the morning
until 12:00 at night,

849
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,329
this motherfucker is dripping in gold,

850
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,581
and I haven't seen a dollar
in overtime yet.

851
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,443
One minute we're killing arabs,
the next minute we're wiping their ass.

852
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,458
Afghanis aren't arabs.

853
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,043
They're not? What are they?

854
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:11,764
Clue's in the name.

855
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,509
Afghanis.

856
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,592
Whatever. They're not Americans.

857
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,971
Do you know what I want to do?

858
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,975
I wanna lift one of those
precious ornaments

859
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,432
until I get my motherfucking overtime pay.

860
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,526
And why don't you?

861
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,231
Why don't I what?

862
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,189
Make them pay.

863
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:36,827
They owe us.

864
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,289
Why are you asking me?

865
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,579
Ask sarge.

866
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,294
Do they keep cash?

867
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:05,651
What's that?

868
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,570
That is it.

869
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:14,191
That's fucking what?

870
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:18,570
That is what is left
after we've washed it through the system.

871
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,572
What's on the table?

872
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:21,907
Hundred ten.

873
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:28,501
Two Rolexes, patek.
Six-carat ring chains, 40 grand cash.

874
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:33,961
Wait a minute. I got hit over the head
and lost my job for, like, 18g's a piece?

875
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,301
Thought we worked out
over half a million in solids?

876
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:38,598
We did the leg work.

877
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,225
- We made the calls...
- Number one.

878
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,927
- Go ahead, four.
- Incoming.

879
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:47,311
We spent the sweat,
we dealt with the fence,

880
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,486
that's what we get.

881
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,447
Salaam-alaikum.

882
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,443
Even split.

883
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:00,116
We're not the mafia we're soldiers.

884
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,655
Nah, something ain't right here.

885
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,789
- You're trying to say something, jan?
- Fuck off, jan.

886
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:11,506
Go find another bone to chew,
vou'll break your teeth on this one.

887
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,504
And stand up when the boss is talking.

888
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:25,520
We could change it though,
cut out the middleman.

889
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:27,598
What does that mean?

890
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:30,934
We want cash...

891
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,362
We go after cash.

892
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:36,531
We've got a guy on the inside.

893
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,243
Inside of what?

894
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,580
Cash trucks.

895
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:49,456
We took in 1.18 million.

896
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,820
That's three years' worth of work
in one payday.

897
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:59,213
$168,571 each.

898
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:01,172
That's a lot of paper right there.

899
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:06,261
- Hold on, that's seven ways, not six?
- Thirty seconds.

900
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,687
There might not be a middleman,

901
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:10,015
but there is a man on the inside,
he needs a slice.

902
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,276
And who is this inside man?

903
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:20,827
You don't need to know.

904
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:26,407
Uh-uh. Yes, motherfuckers, these are
guns and we'll not hesitate to kill you.

905
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,221
Don't be a hero, it's not your money.

906
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:31,161
- Show me your hands.
- Put your hands behind your back.

907
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:34,623
What's your driver's name?
If you lie to me, I'll fucking kill you.

908
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,753
- Chad.
- Chad fucking what?

909
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,426
- Chad Reed.
- Horrible name.

910
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:43,098
Gentlemen, we have found our opportunity
to stand tall again.

911
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,226
After years of taking it,
staring at our laces.

912
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,680
Don't quit your day job just yet.

913
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,016
Rhythm as normal, be smart.

914
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,067
Don't go buying anything flashy.

915
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,645
Just what you absolutely need,
do you hear me, jan?

916
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,648
Oh, yeah, loud and clear, boss.

917
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,818
Groceries, good.

918
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,323
Sports cars, bad.

919
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,957
This isn't retirement money,
but if we play it right, it could be.

920
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,372
Yo, Dave, come in.

921
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,085
Come in, Dave.

922
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,337
Just checking everything's as it should be.

923
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,802
All good here, Chad.

924
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,220
Be out in two.

925
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,650
Did that just go as smooth
as I thought it did?

926
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,348
Don't count your chickens just yet.

927
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:33,942
Hold on.

928
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,857
Gentlemen, if I can just
get your signatures.

929
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,312
- How's it going?
- All right.

930
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:42,941
- Fantastic.
- Thank you.

931
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:48,700
I'm telling you now,
there's more gold in these hills.

932
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,120
Yeah. We haven't even tapped into
our skill set.

933
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,042
Monkeys could've done that job.

934
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,291
- So let's push ourselves then.
- Easy, boys.

935
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,963
Walking before running.

936
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,132
Yeah, I don't know about you guys,

937
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,586
but, uh, I feel like I've been walking
for a long fucking time.

938
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:11,681
J happy birthday to you j

939
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:18,560
j happy birthday, dear Jack j

940
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,655
happy birthday!

941
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:25,860
J happy birthday to you j

942
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:27,996
yeah!

943
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:31,577
Whoa.
It's getting harder and harder.

944
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,291
I know it is my birthday, but...

945
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:39,793
I've got a present for you.

946
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,501
- What are you sitting on, old man?
- More work.

947
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,969
But with a significant bump.

948
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,176
It's another truck.

949
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,058
This time there's gonna be
at least six mil inside.

950
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,095
Now, we're talking.

951
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,056
Well, it's a lot more profitable
than killing arabs.

952
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,686
And it makes my blood flow.

953
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:03,521
Sweetheart, what about the kids?

954
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,824
Yeah, feed them first. Bad animals, bad.

955
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,077
- I'm sorry.
- Here, let me help you with...

956
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:13,956
Is the intel good?

957
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,663
We've got a good inside man.

958
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,917
He's one of us,
served under me back in the day.

959
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:22,669
Well, I'm in.
I just want to get back in the field.

960
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,174
I like the money but I
fucking love a mission.

961
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,922
Yeah, what's the downside?

962
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:30,722
We're gonna be way more exposed.

963
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:32,909
And it will warrant significant planning.

964
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,936
There will be six weeks
of training and recon.

965
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:14,934
Three minutes.

966
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,519
Who the fuck are these clowns?

967
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,569
- Is it gonna be a problem?
- I don't think so.

968
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,119
Five, on the car. Handle fit.
On it

969
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,285
time to go to work, boys.

970
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,793
Gotta get these hinges greased, man.

971
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,549
What is this?

972
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,569
- Freeway's gonna be backed up.
- Oh, fuck! Shit!

973
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,905
Still no response.

974
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,086
Thirty seconds.

975
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,669
Yo! Out of the fucking car, come on.

976
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,924
Don't fucking look at me!
Out of the fucking car.

977
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,506
Let's go, motherfucker.

978
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:39,139
- Fortico 1377, alarm raised.
- Alarm registered.

979
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,515
Face the fucking ground!

980
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,846
- Tires now.
- Move!

981
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,933
Do what we say and you fucking live.

982
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,966
Bravo, two black-and-whites,
en route, two minutes away.

983
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,321
Two units dispatched.

984
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,239
Don't do it.

985
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,116
Eta two minutes. “Two minutes.

986
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,664
No!

987
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,420
Fuck!

988
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:07,917
He shot two fucking guards, Elvis.

989
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:10,967
- He shot two fucking guards.
- Number one, are we good?

990
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,052
Are we good, number one?

991
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,255
We're good.

992
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:31,904
Number one just shot a fucking kid!
He shot a fucking kid!

993
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,447
Dougie!

994
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,025
- Incoming! Incoming on the right!
- It's fine! Incoming!

995
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,951
- I'm on it.
- Take the legs.

996
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,157
What the fuck did you just do?

997
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,163
I said the fucking legs.
Three, take his gun.

998
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,916
Okay, we've got one minute. Let's go!

999
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,840
- Move.
- Exit west. We've got to go! Come on!

1000
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,417
- Let's go.
- Move! Move! Move!

1001
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,921
Let's go! Let's go!

1002
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,012
I'll tell you, man,
I'm surprised to hear from you.

1003
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,931
(Glad we could all make it.

1004
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,218
I'm glad that shit blew over.

1005
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:48,765
You put us in a tight spot, jan.
I'm not sure it has all blown over.

1006
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,476
You're lucky you still got
a seat at this table.

1007
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,489
Ggot it.

1008
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,739
I think we all know we're gonna need
a pension fund.

1009
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:05,665
I can't say I wasn't pleased to have
this meeting. I was starting to itch.

1010
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:09,710
As we are aware, the bigger the reward,
the bigger the risk.

1011
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,422
- Everything comes with a price.
- Are you ready for that?

1012
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,296
'Cause there is no guarantee of success
ohn this one.

1013
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,630
None of this was ever really guaranteed,
was it, sarge?

1014
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,099
We've been through worse.

1015
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:27,220
Yeah, so lay it on us.
We're dying to find out.

1016
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:32,688
We do this right,
we'll never have to work again.

1017
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,815
- Neither will our kids.
- If we get it wrong?

1018
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:36,986
It's game over.

1019
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,700
So, what is it?

1020
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:49,125
We're not hitting a cash truck,
we're hitting them all.

1021
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,418
How is that possible?

1022
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,794
The depot, black Friday.

1023
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,340
How much?

1024
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,301
North of 150 million.

1025
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,973
Ooh

1026
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,764
we've got eight weeks
of recon and planning.

1027
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,736
- Base, this is gamma reporting.
- Come in, over.

1028
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,782
This way.

1029
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,600
That's 160 million divided seven ways.

1030
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,643
We have every Avenue covered.

1031
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:52,221
- Coming, Mr. rossi.
- Thank you, Mr. hill.

1032
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,602
- Signing in.
- This is our best plan.

1033
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:58,356
Yeah. All this is for nothing
if our guy doesn't come through.

1034
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,022
Why does this room always smell so good?

1035
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:03,490
Maybe, one day,
my garden can smell like this.

1036
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,738
I hope you're not planning anything, Dave.

1037
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:09,698
Well, it's black Friday tomorrow,
so, you'll have to wait and see.

1038
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:12,033
If I thought you were serious,
I'd have to report you.

1039
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:15,165
Of course I'm not serious. Or am I?

1040
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:20,295
Anyway, it's action man
you got to look out for, not me.

1041
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:22,217
Yeah, colder than a reptile.

1042
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:24,803
Something's not right.

1043
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:28,132
Well, why do I get the feeling
your money's never been safer, Mr. rossi?

1044
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,218
You don't need to worry.

1045
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,268
He's greedier than you, Tom.
He'll come through.

1046
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,851
Okay, let's run through it one more time.

1047
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,020
Have anyone see my clutch?

1048
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:43,276
- Your... your what?
- My purse, sweetheart.

1049
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,767
There's a green one on the landing.

1050
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:45,942
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

1051
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,036
Come on.

1052
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,577
- What are you doing today, dad?
- I got work.

1053
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,906
- At the mall?
- That's right.

1054
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,491
Will you come to my game after?

1055
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,793
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1056
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,915
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1057
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,337
- Love you, dad.
- Bye, love you.

1058
01:17:58,424 --> 01:17:59,609
- I love you.
- Love you, honey.

1059
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,794
- I come on.
- Bye.

1060
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,924
- I'm gonna be late for work.
- I love you.

1061
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,380
Hurry up, mom!

1062
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:09,469
Okay, bye.

1063
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:13,511
Come on, kids. Get in the car.

1064
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,737
We're all set on our end.

1065
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,816
I'm on my way to pick up jan.

1066
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,026
Now it's all up to you.

1067
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,499
Remember, take different
routes there and back.

1068
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,794
Even a sniff of anything untoward,
you call it in.

1069
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,129
This is black Friday.

1070
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:42,627
The tills will keep ringing.

1071
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,042
So don't take no chances.

1072
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,297
We got close to 180 million
coming in here today.

1073
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:52,018
Have you got it?

1074
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,176
Yes, sir. Got it

1075
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:57,055
I want everything and everyone back.

1076
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:58,931
Safe and sound.

1077
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,024
Let's get going, h.

1078
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,828
What? You don't like it?

1079
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:17,162
How does someone like you
afford a place like this?

1080
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,619
And a $28,000 bike?

1081
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,087
Credit card.

1082
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,291
Calm down, it's not in my name.
Return it.

1083
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,174
Put the beers down.
Grab your gear and let's go.

1084
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,386
Let's go.

1085
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,568
That's the last drop off.

1086
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,596
What is it?

1087
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,844
You know I like you, right, h?

1088
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:20,680
Well, there's something
I need to tell you...

1089
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:22,442
About me.

1090
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,485
I've got some friends...

1091
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,150
I help them out.

1092
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,782
They help me out from time to time.

1093
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,324
My pals...

1094
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,699
I helped them get into
the cash truck game...

1095
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:41,875
In a manner of speaking...

1096
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,667
With me on the inside.

1097
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:48,217
You get me?

1098
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:51,429
No, bullet.

1099
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,265
I don't.

1100
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,800
I tell them which trucks to hit

1101
01:20:58,687 --> 01:20:59,802
and they hit them.

1102
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:04,189
The two guards being killed was necessary.

1103
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:06,850
The boy was unfortunate.

1104
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,399
But we're a winning team.

1105
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,232
Militarily precise.

1106
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:17,202
Are you with me now?

1107
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:19,749
Yeah

1108
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,042
I'm with you, 100 percent.

1109
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,538
Continue.

1110
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,420
For starters, there are
no bullets in your gun.

1111
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,547
Secondly, I have to tell you,

1112
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:35,425
they will kill you if you don't comply.

1113
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,928
So do as I say and you won't get hurt.

1114
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:42,765
Why do you need me?

1115
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:45,438
We need something super-sized,

1116
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,313
so we can walk away for good.

1117
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:51,812
We want the jackpot.

1118
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:55,820
The depot.

1119
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:58,819
You want me to get you in?

1120
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,201
Then you can look the other way.

1121
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,910
When, bullet?

1122
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,246
Today.

1123
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:12,291
There's no turning back.

1124
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:16,420
What's in it for me?

1125
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:19,475
Your life

1126
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:26,813
Do we have a deal?

1127
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:37,074
Yeah we have a deal.

1128
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,785
We're on. Eta, two minutes.

1129
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:44,876
Covers.

1130
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,066
Gamma, this is base.
Do you copy? Over.

1131
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,328
Base, this is gamma, we copy. Over.

1132
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,532
Gamma, I lost camera signal in your truck.
What's happening there? Over.

1133
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:28,467
There's nothing
to worry about, base.

1134
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:30,206
I'm fixing it as we speak.

1135
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:31,958
Copy that, gamma.

1136
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:35,337
Keep me updated, this ain't the day for
this shit. Do you understand me? Over.

1137
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:38,840
Loud and clear.
I'll be in touch as soon as. Over.

1138
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:43,882
We're set.

1139
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,683
Cameras are disarmed.

1140
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:51,390
We meet here at point a.

1141
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:53,350
Warn our hero not to get clever.

1142
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,562
We'll need him to get inside.
After that, if he twitches, kill him.

1143
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:05,579
Just let them do their jobs, okay?

1144
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,156
Let me talk to him.

1145
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:10,951
Hey, handsome.

1146
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:14,789
Today is not the day to be a hero.

1147
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,965
There will be no other warnings.

1148
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:20,173
Am I clear?

1149
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,845
Show me your hands.

1150
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:27,013
Play the game, h.

1151
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:47,598
If you're a good boy today...

1152
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,206
You'll see tomorrow.

1153
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:04,672
Then we divide.

1154
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,974
You, Brad, Carlos and jan
are in the truck.

1155
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:09,972
Me and Sam follow in the escalade.

1156
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:38,799
Be cool, h.

1157
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:40,924
2411, returning.

1158
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,418
Gamma, this is base. Go, over.

1159
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,778
- All good?
- Yeah, except the traffic.

1160
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:03,718
- Dana, come give me a hand.
- No problem.

1161
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:06,950
Right. Let's relieve you of your burden.

1162
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,706
Base, this is gamma, reporting.

1163
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,376
All clear, gamma.

1164
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:29,548
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1165
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:35,012
Gamma 2411 inside.
That's the last one for today.

1166
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:38,599
Once we get pass the gates, it's only a
question of time before we're compromised.

1167
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,534
There's too many guards
that we can't control.

1168
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,777
So we keep it quiet as long as possible.

1169
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,276
The men must be stealthy.
The longer they're stealthed,

1170
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,232
the longer we live without drama.

1171
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:48,658
Hey, bullet.

1172
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:51,031
- All good?
- All good here, supe.

1173
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:54,831
Move, move, now. Move. Go.

1174
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,579
- Whoa.
- Uh-uh-uh.

1175
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,410
Don't you make a sound.

1176
01:26:58,505 --> 01:26:59,585
Down on the ground.

1177
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:00,673
Move.

1178
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:05,213
- Kneel down.
- Tip toe, tip toe, tip toe.

1179
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:07,089
We secure the safe first.

1180
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,590
That's Carlos and jan's job.

1181
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:10,889
Okay, Dave,
that's all good and accounted for...

1182
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:13,262
Hands in the motherfucking air.

1183
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,060
Place your weapons on the ground.
Slowly, slowly.

1184
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:19,231
- Do what he says.
- Take that weapon out, slide it over.

1185
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:21,103
Get over there. Get on the fucking ground.

1186
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,684
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1187
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,942
Grab your gun, put it on the ground
and kick it to me, motherfucker.

1188
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:27,818
Do you wanna be a hero today?

1189
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,949
I'll put you on the front page of every
fucking newspaper in America. Try me.

1190
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:37,376
Get on the ground.

1191
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:39,462
All the way.

1192
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:43,247
Get your fucking ass on the ground.
Tie his ass up.

1193
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,179
Behave yourself.

1194
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,925
Hey. What's up?

1195
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,306
I need you to sign this birthday card
for the boss.

1196
01:27:57,397 --> 01:28:00,230
Bring it up here and have a look at this.
This will make you laugh.

1197
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,558
You, jan and Brad
will take the control room.

1198
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:05,439
Bullet is hostage and shield.

1199
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:08,773
If that doesn't work, we blow our way in.

1200
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:10,774
Keep it fucking quiet.

1201
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,291
Open the gate.

1202
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:23,462
Bob, what the fuck is going on?

1203
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,459
The keypad will
present a challenge.

1204
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,836
The men that operate the armory
are hard-boiled.

1205
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:29,839
They will not be scared
of pulling the trigger.

1206
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,716
At some point, they'll resist.

1207
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:35,550
Open the gate.
Or I'll blow his fucking head off.

1208
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:38,851
You have three seconds.

1209
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:41,351
One! Two!

1210
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,523
- Three!
- Okay!

1211
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,521
- Putting the gun down.
- Open the gate.

1212
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:46,818
The keypad is out there.

1213
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:48,441
You use the keypad.

1214
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:49,817
It's on security lockdown.

1215
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,864
You use the fucking keypad.

1216
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,069
The rabbits have run, number one.

1217
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,199
Two, breach the gate.

1218
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:00,561
At some point, we're gonna come under fire.
They've got long guns, they'll use them.

1219
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,667
Here you go. Take this.

1220
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,085
So we'll need ballistic plates.

1221
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,128
This is your last chance.

1222
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:08,874
I'll blow his head off.

1223
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:11,381
Bob, open the gate,
or they're gonna fucking kill me.

1224
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:12,927
Bullet, get down!

1225
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,098
Shit.

1226
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:21,307
Set!

1227
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:27,942
Nobody fucking move.

1228
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,236
Number three, what's going on?

1229
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:32,867
Don't do it!

1230
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:38,699
Jesus fucking Christ.

1231
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:43,916
Now!

1232
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:56,588
Move, now, move!

1233
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:26,000
Where are you hit? Where are you hit”?

1234
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,792
Four is down. I repeat, four is down.

1235
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,382
Oh, no, no, no!

1236
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:39,886
No, please, sweet Mary and Joseph,
I swear to god.

1237
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:42,388
Look at this little piggy.

1238
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:44,265
Please don't. I got kids, please.

1239
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:48,190
- Yeah...
- Please, don't hurt me. Please.

1240
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:52,693
Enough of that.

1241
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,567
Elvis, come and play.

1242
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:15,800
- One, sweep the rest of the building.
- Copy.

1243
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:27,012
- Five, are we good?
- Clear, Elvis, move in.

1244
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:36,192
Welcome to the party.

1245
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,110
These three are hog tied.

1246
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:41,785
The block is in there,
and another three guards in the back.

1247
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:45,660
SWAT have been alerted.

1248
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:03,682
SWAT have been notified.
All units please respond.

1249
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:07,931
Once the alarm sounds,

1250
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:10,639
black-and-whites will be
on scene within minutes.

1251
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:14,693
But they cannot enter the building.
Even if they could, they wouldn't dare.

1252
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:18,237
However, they are not our problem.
We will have eight minutes

1253
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:19,939
until SWAT arrives.

1254
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:25,404
We can punch through the black-and-whites
with an 18-ton cash truck,

1255
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:27,614
but the SWAT truck's a different story.

1256
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:29,574
We cannot get pinned down.

1257
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,001
We gotta get out
before they seal the exit.

1258
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:33,999
We're eight minutes out. Eight minutes out.

1259
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:36,957
We have men down. Send back
up right now. This is an emergency.

1260
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:39,384
They have heavy assault weapons
and they have body armor.

1261
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:41,511
- Men are down.
- Hold your position.

1262
01:32:41,598 --> 01:32:42,633
They have...

1263
01:32:42,724 --> 01:32:44,885
- Get in, get in.
- We're calling SWAT.

1264
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:46,011
I'm not waiting for SWAT.

1265
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:47,502
We have protocol. We wait for SWAT.

1266
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,974
No, we gotta go now. “Wait!

1267
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:59,605
Two, wait until we're loaded.
Then join three in the truck.

1268
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,405
Nose to the fucking ground.

1269
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:04,571
Did I stutter?

1270
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,751
Load the Van, three.
I'll get five.

1271
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,224
What the fuck
is going on out there?

1272
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,750
There's a guard out here.
Someone shoot this fucker.

1273
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:33,597
Please!

1274
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,149
Shots have been fired.

1275
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,040
Seven minutes out.

1276
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:58,462
Fuck!

1277
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,300
Clear.

1278
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,312
Fuck this, I'm going out.

1279
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:32,572
Listen, the alarm's gone,
we should just wait for help.

1280
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:35,203
What do you want us to do?

1281
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,213
You can do whatever you fucking like.

1282
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:52,725
David, no, listen to me. They got
body armor. That gun will do nothing.

1283
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:55,428
And this is not your money. Let's go.

1284
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,930
Fucking go. Go, go!

1285
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:04,983
We're six minutes out.

1286
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:21,038
One, four is down. I repeat, four
is down. Do you have eyes on three?

1287
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:23,672
Three respond.

1288
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:27,006
Who's firing?

1289
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:36,181
Copy that, all units...

1290
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:37,603
Three is down.

1291
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:40,432
We've got a rat on the loose.

1292
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,147
Elvis is leaving the building.

1293
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:48,402
David, just put
the gun down and hide.

1294
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:51,513
- The SWAT team, they're on their way.
- If something goes down in the hallway,

1295
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:53,869
- I'm gonna shoot them, Terry.
- There's no need.

1296
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,580
Making my way to you now, Elvis.

1297
01:35:58,962 --> 01:36:00,168
Fuck!

1298
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:04,038
Come on out, and you won't get hurt.

1299
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,755
Come on, come here.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1300
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:25,690
- Move!
- Some SWAT, some choppers, bring someone in.

1301
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,520
Here, take this.

1302
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:39,453
Man down.

1303
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:49,292
Stay down.

1304
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:56,508
Four minutes out.
“We're four minutes out.

1305
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,416
Help!

1306
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:08,205
Dave, are you all right?

1307
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:11,086
SWAT team are
three minutes away, find cover.

1308
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:21,593
We're sitting ducks here.

1309
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:30,404
Give me a gun.

1310
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:32,061
Fucking...

1311
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:33,896
Give me a gun!

1312
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,492
- Thank you.
- Bullet, what the...

1313
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:41,475
- Clear.
- We gotta move.

1314
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:42,619
Come on, get up. Move.

1315
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,745
We got two minutes
until SWAT is here.

1316
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:49,624
Clear!

1317
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:53,924
Stay with me, stay with me.

1318
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:55,846
Come on, come on.

1319
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:20,704
Four is down!

1320
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,319
Hey, boy sweat! It's bullet!

1321
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:55,405
Bullet?

1322
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:59,656
Come give me a hand.

1323
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:05,033
Bullet! What the...

1324
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:21,591
You're good?

1325
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,388
We're good. Let's go.

1326
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:48,164
Once the truck is loaded and we're all in,
we punch through the black-and-whites.

1327
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:50,162
Exit right.

1328
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:52,790
They and the choppers will be in pursuit,

1329
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,417
but there's nothing they can do to stop us.

1330
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:15,391
Fuck!

1331
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:25,701
From here it's two klicks to meet
at rendez point to enter building d.

1332
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:27,995
The gates here will stop
any immediate intrusion.

1333
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:32,041
Heading south on 408. We have
visual. We have four birds in the sky.

1334
01:41:34,964 --> 01:41:36,295
It doesn't change a thing.

1335
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:38,043
You stick to the plan.

1336
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:41,842
Get ready.

1337
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:01,563
We will have five
minutes until SWAT breaches.

1338
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:04,444
They'll think we're trapped, shoot to kill,
but we won't be there.

1339
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:08,198
There's no way they can know about
this access tunnel underneath the basement.

1340
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:10,245
This doesn't come up on any blueprints.

1341
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:12,198
They stopped printing this back in '57.

1342
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:15,456
We have them
surrounded. SWAT has arrived on scene.

1343
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:19,789
A-team, let's go. Into position.

1344
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:26,887
How are you doing, sarge?

1345
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:33,679
If I don't make it,
get back there and finish the job.

1346
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:37,294
We are stationary and setting
up a blockade. Awaiting further orders.

1347
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:41,071
(50.

1348
01:42:44,283 --> 01:42:45,739
That's the last of it let's move.

1349
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:49,034
- All units you are clear to fire.
- Roger, dispatch.

1350
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,456
Okay, I'll get the boss.

1351
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:07,127
Whoa, whoa.

1352
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:12,391
You're not gonna need that, sarge.

1353
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,418
We all understand the risks.

1354
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:42,754
Some of us won't make it.

1355
01:43:44,093 --> 01:43:46,550
If there is a last man standing,

1356
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:49,299
it's his job to take care of the families.

1357
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:51,881
I wish I was confident
that will happen, but...

1358
01:43:51,976 --> 01:43:53,637
My only concern is jan.

1359
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:59,559
Strange things happen to men
when they smell that much cash.

1360
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:04,067
He's a soldier.
In the end, he'll follow orders.

1361
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:10,199
- Where's the sarge?
- He's not coming.

1362
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:13,824
- What do you mean he's not coming?
- He's fucking dead, bullet.

1363
01:44:42,318 --> 01:44:45,060
From here, we load the can-am quads,
ride three more klicks

1364
01:44:45,154 --> 01:44:48,237
to the silver prius, load
the cash undercover.

1365
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:52,784
And whoever's left
takes the construction pickup.

1366
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:36,326
Uh-uh-uh. Too fucking slow.

1367
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:04,726
All right, team.
Move in. Weapons ready.

1368
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:08,776
- Copy.
- Suspects still in vehicle. Moving in.

1369
01:46:08,863 --> 01:46:10,478
- Move!
- Go.

1370
01:46:10,573 --> 01:46:12,188
What the fuck...

1371
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:15,486
We got one dead suspect.

1372
01:46:15,578 --> 01:46:17,159
The others are fucking gone.

1373
01:46:17,246 --> 01:46:18,736
We need more bodies down here.
Shit

1374
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:21,243
- there's tunnel's everywhere,
- Captain.

1375
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:24,773
There's a network of underground tunnels.
It's like a fucking rabbit Warren down there.

1376
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:40,975
3737, we do not have
visual. We need more eyes in the sky.

1377
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:44,599
Copy that. Additional air
units covering long beach dock.

1378
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:46,851
We're entering industrial unit
on terminal way.

1379
01:46:46,942 --> 01:46:50,526
We need more choppers up here.
There are tunnels coming out everywhere.

1380
01:48:43,976 --> 01:48:45,557
Aren't you gonna answer it?

1381
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:57,565
What do you want?

1382
01:49:00,826 --> 01:49:02,236
You here for the money?

1383
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:04,989
I don't want the money.

1384
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:08,914
I want you to read this.

1385
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:25,802
"Bullets a1 and a2 enter the right lung
causing collapse"?

1386
01:49:26,518 --> 01:49:29,180
"Bullet b1 penetrated the liver.

1387
01:49:30,105 --> 01:49:32,437
B2 ruptured the spleen.

1388
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:39,149
Bullets c1 and c2 lacerated the heart.

1389
01:49:39,865 --> 01:49:42,322
Cause of death. Blood loss and trauma.

01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:44,696
Manner of death, homicide."

1391
01:50:00,177 --> 01:50:01,257
In summary...

1392
01:50:03,138 --> 01:50:04,253
The liver...

1393
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:10,017
The lungs, the spleen and the heart.

1394
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:14,562
What the fuck do you want?

1395
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,060
I want your liver.

1396
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:22,483
Fuck you.

1397
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:27,742
The lungs...

1398
01:50:34,837 --> 01:50:35,952
Spleen...

1399
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:48,176
By the way...

1400
01:50:51,603 --> 01:50:53,218
His name was Dougie.

1401
01:51:43,864 --> 01:51:45,024
Are we done?

1402
01:51:46,283 --> 01:51:47,398
We're done.
