1
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,189
News has come from Vienna!

2
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:40,099
"Leopold of Austria has seized King
Richard on his return from the Crusades.

3
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:45,104
Our king is being held prisoner.
Nothing further is known.

4
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,754
His Highness Prince John will make...

5
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:50,696
...further public
pronouncement tomorrow".

6
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:56,486
And how are the dear Saxons
taking the news, Sir Guy?

7
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:59,715
They're even more worried than
Longchamps, Your Highness.

8
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:01,346
They'll be more than worried...

9
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,694
...when I squeeze the fat
out of their hides.

10
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,347
- You intend to act on your plans?
- What better moment than this, Sir Guy?

11
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,705
Whoever would have thought
my dear brother...

12
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,238
...would be so
considerate as to get captured...

13
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,659
...and leave all of England
to my tender care?

14
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,206
He may disapprove when he returns,
Your Highness.

15
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,509
If he returns.
And I'll see to it that he doesn't.

16
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:28,121
We must drink to this moment, Sir Guy.
Golden days are ahead.

17
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:32,117
I'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow.

18
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,786
Tomorrow, Your Highness.

19
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:48,387
- But who's gonna pay me?
- Pay! Pay!

20
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,465
That's all you Saxons think about.

21
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:55,182
Didn't I tell you it was for Prince John,
who's just come up from London?

22
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,436
Stop! Stop!

23
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,467
This man is freeborn!
He's a landowner.

24
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,559
You can't make a slave of him!

25
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,090
Didn't he refuse to send his men
to work in Guy of Gisbourne's field?

26
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:14,120
But I protest...!

27
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,490
Dickon, follow me!
The rest remain here.

28
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:17,922
- What's your name, you Saxon dog?
- A better one than yours.

29
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,454
Look to your manners!
This is Sir Guy of Gisbourne.

30
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,280
Sir Guy or the devil!
There's little to choose between them.

31
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:26,806
- What's your name?
- Much, the miller's son.

32
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,411
- It's death to kill the king's deer?
- And death from hunger if I don't.

33
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,166
Thanks to you and the rest of you
Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle.

34
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,362
- Be quiet, you.
- I won't be quiet!

35
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:39,570
You can kill me if you like,
but not until I've had my say.

36
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,298
You can beat and starve
us Saxons now...

37
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:45,965
...but when King Richard escapes, he'll
take you by the scruff of the neck...

38
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:48,404
...and fling you into the sea!

39
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,614
- What the devil?
- Come now, Sir Guy.

40
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:05,721
- You'd kill a man for telling the truth?
- If it amused me, yes.

41
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:08,018
Be thankful
my humor's of a different sort.

42
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,259
By what right do you
interfere with justice?

43
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:12,557
By a better right
than you have to misuse it.

44
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:14,687
That goes for your master, Prince John.

45
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:18,718
I'll give him that message at the
baron's meeting in Nottingham tonight.

46
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,065
Thank you.
He does need a bit of a talking to.

47
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:23,837
- Eh, Will?
- He has been getting rather out of hand.

48
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:26,199
- Fetch him.
- Hold there. What's his fault?

49
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:29,286
- He's killed a royal deer.
- You're wrong. I killed that deer.

50
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:30,855
This man's my servant.

51
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:35,364
Oh. I suppose you realize the penalty
for killing the king's deer is death.

52
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:38,943
- Whether for serf or noble.
- Really?

53
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,565
Are there no exceptions?

54
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,245
- Thanks, master.
- Better look before you shoot next time.

55
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:03,041
From this day, I follow only you. There
isn't a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire...

56
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,874
...that doesn't know and bless
Sir Robin of Locksley.

57
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,718
Take me as your servant.

58
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,116
Why, in all the forest,
there isn't a hunter as good as me.

59
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:14,452
I ask no pay.
Just to follow you.

60
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:16,742
Fetch the deer, then.

61
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,180
While Richard is bent on adventure
in foreign lands...

62
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:08,906
...it is our duty as Normans
to preserve the realm...

63
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:11,413
...by giving loyal support
to Prince John...

64
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:14,074
...the only true defender
of the Norman spirit.

65
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:16,106
Hail to Prince John.

66
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,659
My lords, I thank you.
Well, this is what we Normans like:

67
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:33,629
Good food, good company...

68
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:37,343
...and a beautiful woman
to flatter me, eh, Lady Marian?

69
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,783
Was it worthwhile coming with me
from London...

70
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,513
...to see what stout fellows
our Nottingham friends are?

71
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:47,268
Take Sir Guy of Gisbourne. One of our
most renowned defenders of the realm.

72
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,468
Must I take him, Your Highness?

73
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,154
Why, you like him, don't you?

74
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,906
- Well, he's a Norman, of course.
- Is that the only reason for liking him?

75
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,387
Isn't that reason enough for a royal ward
who must obey her guardian?

76
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,965
Oh, nay, I'd not force you, my lady.

77
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:06,831
But he's our most powerful friend in
these shires and he's in love with you.

78
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:12,352
If I could promise him marriage
to a royal ward, it might help my plans.

79
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:15,260
- Perhaps when I know him better.
- Of course.

80
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,007
You're a very wise young woman.

81
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:21,967
Any more objections to the new tax
from our Saxon friends?

82
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:25,493
Objections, Your Highness?
With a Saxon dangling from every...

83
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,949
...gallows tree
between here and Charnwood?

84
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,652
Well said, sir knight.
But not too many, mind.

85
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,921
Else we'll have nobody left
to till our land or pay the tax.

86
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,969
There's one exception I'd make,
Your Highness.

87
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,538
- A certain Saxon noble.
- Who is that?

88
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:46,128
- Sir Robin of Locksley.
- Sir Rob... Sir Robin of Locksley?

89
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,408
I've heard precious little else since I've
been here. What's his latest outrage?

90
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:54,871
Oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer
in Sherwood Forest today.

91
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:57,612
And you didn't take him?

92
00:08:57,873 --> 00:09:00,068
That would have been a problem,
Your Highness.

93
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:04,373
- A Saxon a problem?
- He's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.

94
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:06,593
Aye.
An impudent, reckless rogue...

95
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:09,960
...who goes around the shire
stirring up the Saxons against authority.

96
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:13,820
And he has the insolence to set himself
up as a protector of the people.

97
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:16,496
I could have captured him
long ago, but...

98
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:17,758
But what?

99
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:21,209
Well, he's the deadliest archer
in England, and...

100
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:25,914
And my brave High Sheriff
of Nottingham is afraid of him.

101
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,157
I want him taken and hanged. At once,
do you hear? I'll not tolerate...

102
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,974
Open the door!

103
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:53,221
Who is this, this...?

104
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:57,533
- Sir Robin of Locksley, Your Highness.
- Ah!

105
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:02,850
Let him approach.

106
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:16,716
Greetings, Your Highness.

107
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:19,322
You should teach Gisbourne hospitality.

108
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,143
I no sooner enter his castle doors
with a piece of meat...

109
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:25,092
...than his starving servants
try to snatch it from me.

110
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:28,299
You should feed them, Gisbourne.
They'll work better.

111
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:32,031
With the compliments of your royal
brother, King Richard, God bless him!

112
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:36,157
By my faith, but you're a bold rascal.

113
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:39,353
Robin, I like you.

114
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,324
I'm gratified, Your Highness.

115
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:44,031
I don't think Gisbourne shares
that sentiment, however.

116
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:46,162
He does look sour.

117
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:49,093
What's the matter, Gisbourne?
Run out of hangings?

118
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:51,875
- I know a ripe subject for one.
- If you'll excuse me...

119
00:10:52,156 --> 00:10:54,511
Sit down! Sit down, my dear.
He'll not harm you.

120
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:57,696
Sir Robin, this is
the Lady Marian Fitzwalter.

121
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:01,571
I hope my lady had a pleasant journey
from London?

122
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,988
What you hope can hardly be important.

123
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:08,190
What a pity her manners
don't match her looks, Your Highness.

124
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,874
You hear that, gentlemen?

125
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:14,245
Here's Gisbourne so in love with Marian
he daren't say "boo" to her...

126
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:17,706
...and this saucy fellow
gives her better than she sends.

127
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:22,693
My lords and ladies, I would like to
present to you Sir Robin of Locksley.

128
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:30,059
Sir Robin, permit me to present to you
your host, Sir Guy of Gisbourne...

129
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:34,237
...and our noble guests.
- I'm deeply honored, Your Highness.

130
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:36,610
- Have you had meat?
- None but what I brought.

131
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,823
Well, sit down.
Sit down there opposite me.

132
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:42,309
- Get up, Sir Ivor. Give him your place.
- Your Highness!

133
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:44,215
Get up!
Get up, sir knight!

134
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,964
Come, Sir Ivor. Out with you.

135
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:50,089
Bring Sir Robin food at once,
do you hear?

136
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:53,578
Such impudence must support
a mighty appetite.

137
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,204
True enough, Your Highness.

138
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:59,819
We Saxons have little to fatten on by
the time your tax gatherers are through.

139
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:03,301
Be seated, gentlemen. No need
to stand on ceremony on my account.

140
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:07,748
So you think you're overtaxed, eh?

141
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:11,381
Overtaxed, overworked and paid off
with a knife, a club or a rope.

142
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:14,494
- Why, you speak treason.
- Fluently.

143
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,056
I advise you to curb
that wagging tongue of yours!

144
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:19,001
It's a habit I've never formed.

145
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:23,283
You know, we Saxons aren't gonna put
up with these oppressions much longer.

146
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:26,660
Oh, you're not?
Then listen to this:

147
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:30,997
As you may know, my brother
is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria.

148
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:37,336
And from Leopold, I have received a
ransom demand of 150,000 gold marks.

149
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:40,356
That means that you, my friends...

150
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:44,634
...must collect in taxes not 2 gold marks
in the pound, but 3!

151
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:47,288
And the money's to be
turned over to me.

152
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,044
Why to you, Your Highness?

153
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,265
King Richard
appointed Longchamps regent.

154
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:53,562
I've kicked Longchamps out.

155
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,130
From now on, I am regent of England.

156
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:03,198
Well, confound it,
what are you goggling at?

157
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:07,005
Is it so strange that I decide to rule
when my brother's a prisoner?

158
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:08,768
Who's to say I shouldn't?

159
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:12,439
- You, Sir Mortimer of Leeds?
- Not I, Your Highness.

160
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,711
- You, Sir Boron?
- Nor I, Your Highness.

161
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:19,942
- You, Sir Ralf of Durham?
- My sword is yours, Your Highness.

162
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,746
And what about our young
Saxon cockerel here?

163
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:29,554
What's the matter?
Have you no stomach for honest meat?

164
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:32,739
For honest meat, yes.
But I've no stomach for traitors.

165
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:37,196
- You call me traitor?
- You? Yes.

166
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:39,806
And every man here
who offers you allegiance.

167
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:44,038
Your Highness.

168
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,200
What do you call a man who takes
advantage of a king's misfortune...

169
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:51,696
...to seize his power?

170
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,798
And now, with the help
of this sweet band of cutthroats...

171
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,719
...you'll try to grind a ransom for him
out of every helpless Saxon.

172
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:01,930
A ransom that'll be used
not to release Richard...

173
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:04,294
...but to buy your way to the throne.

174
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:07,286
Let me ram those words down
his throat, Your Highness!

175
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:12,353
Oh, no. Later.
Let him spout for the moment.

176
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:16,124
And what do you propose to do?

177
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:23,394
I'll organize revolt.
Exact a death for a death.

178
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:27,374
And I'll never rest until every Saxon
in this shire can stand up, free men...

179
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,664
...and strike a blow
for Richard and England.

180
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,479
- Have you finished?
- I'm only just beginning.

181
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:36,066
From this night on, I use every means
in my power to fight you.

182
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,529
Dickon!

183
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:10,761
Such impudence, Your Highness.
If I could only reach him.

184
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:17,543
Stand back! Stand back!

185
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,042
Open the door!

186
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:26,193
Quick, guards, quick!
There's a traitor inside trying to escape!

187
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:28,165
- Shut the door!
- Traitor, sir?

188
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:51,122
You infernal idiot!
Which way did he go?

189
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:52,588
There, through the gate.

190
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:56,521
- After him!
- Guards! Horses!

191
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:59,536
Dickon, follow Mansfield!
To your troop!

192
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,038
Up you go, quick.

193
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:03,229
Find Crippen
the arrow-maker and his friends...

194
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:06,320
...to pass the word to every man
who's been beaten or tortured:

195
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:08,810
The Gallows Oaks
in Sherwood tomorrow.

196
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:11,351
- Yes, master.
- Off you go, and good luck.

197
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:36,202
Have it proclaimed in every village
that this Saxon Locksley's an outlaw.

198
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,350
Hang anybody
that gives him shelter or aid.

199
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:39,593
Yes, Your Highness.

200
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:43,443
His possessions are forfeit to the crown.
Seize his castle and his lands.

201
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:46,051
Everything he owns.

202
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,960
And just to let the people know
how the wind has changed...

203
00:19:50,283 --> 00:19:54,674
...the sooner you begin collecting the...
- The ransom, Your Highness?

204
00:19:55,997 --> 00:20:00,115
Yes, yes, of course.
The ransom.

205
00:20:04,257 --> 00:20:07,408
There's a death sentence
for your Robin of Locksley!

206
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:14,315
I'll have him dangling in a week.

207
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,527
- I'm tired.
- What?

208
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:23,730
After a refreshing sleep
in the greenwood?

209
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:25,895
I've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.

210
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:28,986
- Lovely fresh air.
- My teeth ache with chattering.

211
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:32,638
- Nightingales singing.
- An owl hooting in my ear all night.

212
00:20:32,952 --> 00:20:35,864
Hooting?
He was singing you to sleep.

213
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:51,652
There's a lusty infant. He'd be
a good one to reason into joining us.

214
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,167
By the look of him, his
quarterstaff does his reasoning for him.

215
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:59,183
- Let's see what he's made of.
- It's your skull, not mine.

216
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,397
- Give way, little man.
- Only to a better man than myself.

217
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:10,388
He stands before you.

218
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:16,947
Let him pass, Robin. It's much too warm
to brawl with such a windbag.

219
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:20,883
When I've brushed this fly off,
I'll give you a dusting for good measure.

220
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:23,404
This fly has a mighty sting, friend.

221
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:27,226
I've only a staff and you threaten me
with a longbow and a goose shaft.

222
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:31,666
- Aren't you man enough...?
- Wait! I'll get myself a staff.

223
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:48,341
- Ready?
- Yes.

224
00:21:58,037 --> 00:22:01,507
Pretty fellow, play a livelier tune that
I can make this puny rascal dance to.

225
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,899
You need a merrier tune?
Well, how's this?

226
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,169
Ha!

227
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:16,282
Ha!

228
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:18,664
If you want a lesson,
you came to the right man!

229
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:20,965
- Where is he?
- Who?

230
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,029
- This quarterstaff master.
- Here.

231
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,825
Give my compliments to him.

232
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:30,418
My friend, I should ask payment
for what I'm teaching you here today.

233
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:33,596
There's something on account.

234
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:37,413
There's your change.

235
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:04,733
My head hums like a swarm of bees.
What's your name, friend?

236
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:08,094
- John Little. What's yours?
- Robin.

237
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:10,392
- Not Robin of Locksley?
- Aye.

238
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:14,361
- Then I'm right glad I fell in with you.
- 'Twas he who did the falling in.

239
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:19,954
I wanted to see what you were made of.
And I did.

240
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:23,006
- I hope you'll not hold it against me.
- On the contrary.

241
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,088
- I love a man that can best me.
- I'd like to join your company.

242
00:23:26,377 --> 00:23:29,733
You shall. If you can hold a breach
like you held that bridge...

243
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:31,446
...you're one of us. Welcome.

244
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:33,790
- This is Will of Gamwell.
- Yeah.

245
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,440
- He took care not to wet his feathers.
- Just brain over brawn, friend.

246
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:43,132
You heard Robin's orders.
Look nippy now and spread the word.

247
00:23:46,145 --> 00:23:48,136
"By royal decree, Robin of Locksley...

248
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:50,752
...is declared an outlaw,
condemned to death".

249
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:53,016
Meet Robin in Sherwood
at Gallows Oaks.

250
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,427
"Any person aiding him will be hanged".

251
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:57,766
Meet Robin in Sherwood
at Gallows Oaks.

252
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,355
Robin in Sherwood.

253
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:03,213
At the Gallows Oak.

254
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:05,454
Robin in Sherwood.

255
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:06,983
Robin. Gallows Oak.

256
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:12,086
Gallows Oak.

257
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:18,260
I've called you here as freeborn
Englishmen, loyal to our king.

258
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,709
While he reigned over us
we lived in peace.

259
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:23,124
But since Prince John has seized
the regency...

260
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:26,543
...Guy of Gisbourne and his traitors
have murdered and pillaged.

261
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:30,324
You've all suffered from their cruelty.
The ear loppings, the beatings...

262
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:33,404
...the blindings with hot irons,
the burning of our homes...

263
00:24:33,695 --> 00:24:36,653
...the mistreatment of our women.
It's time we put an end to this!

264
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:39,416
- Robin's right.
- Aye!

265
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:41,429
Now, this forest is wide.

266
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:44,494
It can shelter, clothe and feed
a band of good, determined men...

267
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:46,939
...good swordsmen, good archers,
good fighters!

268
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:51,405
Men, if you're willing to fight for our
people, I want you. Are you with me?

269
00:24:51,754 --> 00:24:53,233
Aye! Aye!

270
00:24:53,797 --> 00:24:56,265
Then kneel and swear this oath.

271
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,269
That you, the freemen of this forest,
swear to despoil the rich...

272
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,953
...only to give to the poor.

273
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:06,096
To shelter the old and helpless...

274
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:09,312
...to protect all women,
rich or poor, Norman or Saxon.

275
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:11,517
Swear to fight for a free England.

276
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:15,893
To protect her loyally until the return
of our king, Richard the Lion-Heart.

277
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:18,672
And swear to fight to the death
against our oppressors!

278
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:21,747
We do! We do solemnly swear!

279
00:25:42,388 --> 00:25:44,344
String him up again!

280
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:48,829
- He'll die if we lash him again, my lord.
- Oh, he'll die, will he?

281
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:52,535
Another one of their Saxon impudences.
They'll do anything to trick us.

282
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:54,529
Continue!

283
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:06,221
- Mercy, good master! Have mercy!
- Start him dancing!

284
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:22,751
This will teach you to defy Prince John!

285
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:28,658
Father! Father!

286
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:34,161
Stop!

287
00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:46,872
Five men dead. Murdered.
Sir Ivor, Nigel, Baldwin, Norbert.

288
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:49,877
- You don't have to name them.
- Our men can't lay a hot iron...

289
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:53,442
...in the eyes of a tax dodger without
getting an arrow in the throat.

290
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:56,028
- He's got to be stopped!
- Have you tried to stop him?

291
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,361
Yes, but I couldn't find him.

292
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:01,868
What chance has anyone of finding him?

293
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:04,412
Every villager
and woodcutter's his friend.

294
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:07,400
Every runaway serf and Saxon thief
in the shire is joining him.

295
00:27:07,684 --> 00:27:10,323
I've sent spies in the forest
to find out his hiding place...

296
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:14,721
...but he strikes, and gone like a flash.
- While you stay safely at home.

297
00:27:15,608 --> 00:27:18,168
Do you question my valor?
Am I not commanding the force...

298
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:21,242
...that goes with Sir Guy and
Lady Marian to Kenworth Castle...

299
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,602
...to guard the tax money he is bringing
back, with my sword and life?

300
00:27:24,908 --> 00:27:28,298
I only hope this murderer
does come out of his hiding place.

301
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:29,941
You hope!

302
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:36,907
Enough of this wrangling! I'll lay this
outlaw by the heels when I get back.

303
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:09,481
Well, well. A curtal friar,
and a mighty fat one at that.

304
00:28:09,828 --> 00:28:12,388
- He's the man we need. I'll enlist him.
- Be careful, Robin.

305
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:14,815
That's the friar of Fountain's Abbey.
He's noted...

306
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:17,917
Yeah, that's right.
Noted for his piety.

307
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:21,285
A humble soul, he is,
with a heart as gentle as a lamb.

308
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,229
- Be easy with him, master.
- Oh, I won't harm him.

309
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,105
You stay here lest you frighten him.
Don't interfere.

310
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,185
That's one of the most
dangerous swordsmen...

311
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:32,754
Shh!

312
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:20,375
Bless my soul, a miracle!

313
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:30,658
Robber! Thief!
Give me back my mutton joint!

314
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:31,988
Whoa!

315
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:36,859
If you're a robber
you'll get nothing from me.

316
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,922
I'm a curtal friar and vowed to poverty.

317
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,728
If this is poverty,
I'll gladly share it with you.

318
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:44,883
That's what you are doing.
Give me back my mutton joint!

319
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,768
Not so close, my ponderous one.

320
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,044
- I'd have a word with you.
- Well?

321
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:52,057
I live in the forest with good fellows...

322
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,582
...who've everything in life
save spiritual guidance.

323
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:56,079
And no merit but one.

324
00:29:56,313 --> 00:29:58,543
- And what's that?
- We're outlaws.

325
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:02,585
Since we're newborn to the greenwood,
we need someone to do our christenings.

326
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:05,736
- So we've chosen you.
- Not I.

327
00:30:06,032 --> 00:30:08,148
They've probably
all got your taking ways.

328
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:10,922
Of course.
But you'll love them, one and all.

329
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:15,526
Let's waste no more time. We'll
take the shortcut across the stream.

330
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,600
- Come.
- I'll not. I'm happy here.

331
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:20,833
- You will come.
- Ah!

332
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,210
Now, since I don't care
to get my feet wet...

333
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:26,217
...you'll carry me across on your back.

334
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:29,460
- On my back?
- Bend! You must learn obedience.

335
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:37,129
Come on, bend.

336
00:30:41,691 --> 00:30:43,488
On, now!

337
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:52,630
Come on! On! On! Faster!
I'll have a gallop from you yet.

338
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:20,909
Come now, fat one. Why not give up?
You can see I'm a better swordsman.

339
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:25,918
After I let a little air into your bellows
you'll whistle a different tune.

340
00:31:56,391 --> 00:31:59,189
By Our Lady,
you're the fairest swordsman I ever met.

341
00:31:59,478 --> 00:32:02,197
Must we go on, then?
I think we're even now, friar.

342
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:05,200
Even? Nay. You're still ahead of me
by half a leg of mutton.

343
00:32:05,484 --> 00:32:07,873
- So...
- No. Hold there, friar. Enough.

344
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:10,905
Come with me and I'll promise you
the finest venison pasty...

345
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,596
...and the biggest you ever ate.

346
00:32:12,824 --> 00:32:17,056
Beef, boar's head, casks of ale.

347
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:22,512
If you'd said that before, you'd have
saved us both a wetting. Come along.

348
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,107
- You'll join us?
- Aye.

349
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:27,885
If only to convert you
from your thieving ways.

350
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:31,844
You're Robin Hood, aren't you?

351
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:34,654
The holy henchman!

352
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,649
Hail, doubting friar!

353
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:40,041
- Robin.
- Aye?

354
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:41,497
He's well named Friar Tuck.

355
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,606
It would take half the deer
in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern.

356
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:49,432
And twice that to fill your empty head.

357
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,576
- Whoa, Will!
- What news, Will?

358
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:59,478
- I've got word...
- It's all right. He's one of us.

359
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:02,386
One of us?
He looks like three of us.

360
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:05,022
Aye.
And equal to a full dozen.

361
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:09,163
Now, now, now, now.
Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett. What's it, Will?

362
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:12,138
Sir Guy of Gisbourne
is stopping by the way tonight.

363
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:14,019
- Has he got the tax money?
- A fortune!

364
00:33:14,263 --> 00:33:15,821
- He enters Sherwood when?
- Tomorrow.

365
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:20,572
We'll have to postpone that stuffing
match, but it'll be double tomorrow!

366
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:24,052
Come! Back to camp, men!
Here, curb your appetite with that.

367
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:41,345
- Are you ready, men?
- Aye.

368
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,695
Aye!

369
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:11,510
- See anything of them?
- Not yet.

370
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:13,871
Is everything ready?

371
00:34:14,115 --> 00:34:17,391
They'll think they've got into
a blooming hornet's nest.

372
00:34:22,038 --> 00:34:23,232
There they come.

373
00:34:43,476 --> 00:34:45,387
Hadn't we better
send out flanking guards?

374
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:46,634
What for?

375
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:48,572
This is Sherwood, and Robin Hood...

376
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:52,649
- Afraid of that gallows-face?
- Afraid? Certainly not, sir.

377
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:56,794
But it's here that he's boldest.

378
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:59,589
Don't worry. We're more
than enough to take care of him.

379
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,668
Outlaws have no face to show
themselves against armed troops.

380
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:05,231
Are you sure?
I seem to remember...

381
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:09,255
He jumps out of ambush at small parties,
but he wouldn't dare to attack us.

382
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:13,375
- Well, you old rooster, what do you see?
- Make ready. They're in two sections.

383
00:35:13,716 --> 00:35:15,866
- Do you see Sir Guy?
- He's leading the second.

384
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:17,610
The treasure wagon is with him.

385
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:46,548
Robin! Sir Guy and the sheriff
are watering their horses.

386
00:35:46,873 --> 00:35:49,262
- The advance guard's far ahead.
- Good. Little John!

387
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:51,613
Take your men
and cut off the first section.

388
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:53,311
- Surround the advance guard.
- Aye!

389
00:35:53,547 --> 00:35:54,662
Personally!

390
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:57,764
- Ready, men?
- Aye, Robin!

391
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:02,762
Then stand ready for the signal. Come,
Will. Come on, let's welcome Sir Guy.

392
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:05,356
- Look!
- The guard! Quick!

393
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,339
Welcome to Sherwood, my lady.

394
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:59,766
What, Sir Guy, no greeting from you?
Why, that's curious.

395
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,008
I've often heard you'd give me a
warm welcome if ever we met again.

396
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:08,073
- You're permitting this without even...?
- Fighting?

397
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:12,137
- I'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.
- Well, I have, you impudent rascal!

398
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:15,039
You're not going to harm my lamb,
my honeysuckle.

399
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:16,544
Be still, Bess.

400
00:38:16,776 --> 00:38:19,336
We've nothing but peaceful intentions.
Have we, men?

401
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:22,250
We only want to stroke his pretty neck.

402
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,488
- We won't harm him much.
- You see?

403
00:38:25,785 --> 00:38:27,821
Well, let's away.

404
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:49,671
Don't bother to mark the way.
It'll take keener men than you've got...

405
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:52,772
...to find our camp again.
- You'll hang for this, all of you.

406
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:55,939
A small price to pay for the company
of such a charming lady.

407
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:59,703
What can a Saxon hedge-robber
know of charm? Or ladies?

408
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:02,145
- She means you.
- Me? A hedge-robber?

409
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,319
You must tell me more about myself.
You may have been misinformed.

410
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:08,654
Perhaps, but I don't find it interesting
enough to bother about.

411
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,645
You just harm one hair
of my lady's head...

412
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:18,945
...and that ugly face of yours will walk
about with no neck under it. Now, mind!

413
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:22,092
- What are you staring at?
- I ain't never been out walking...

414
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:24,339
...with a female before.
- What female?

415
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:28,269
- You.
- Well, of all the impudence!

416
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,234
I suppose you say that to all women
that tickle your fancy.

417
00:39:31,517 --> 00:39:33,826
I've never tickled
a woman's fancy before.

418
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:36,014
No, I've never had a sweetheart.

419
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:40,978
Do you mean to say you never had one
single sweetheart in all your life?

420
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:45,440
You don't know what you missed,
my lad.

421
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:47,893
I've had the bands on five times.

422
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,145
My lord! Your robes for the feast.
Hurry up, put them on.

423
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:14,027
- I won't!
- You will!

424
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,585
I will! I will!

425
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:26,722
To them, this is heaven.

426
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:31,579
Silks for rags, kindness instead of riches,
limitless food instead of hunger.

427
00:40:31,953 --> 00:40:34,706
- Why, they're actually happy.
- Are they?

428
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:38,035
Aren't you even a little pleased
to see them enjoying themselves?

429
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,167
I think it's revolting.

430
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:45,862
Your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it,
my lady? Too sheltered, perhaps.

431
00:40:46,218 --> 00:40:49,335
But if you could know these people
as I know them.

432
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:51,788
Their patience, loyalty, goodness.

433
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:55,667
Friar Tuck!
These should fit Sir Guy.

434
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:06,426
Me lord. Here is your raiment
for the banquet.

435
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:09,932
When you've done with them,
give them to Prince John.

436
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,679
To the tables, everybody,
and stuff yourselves!

437
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,311
May I serve you, my lady?

438
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,855
I'm afraid the company
has spoiled my appetite.

439
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:28,363
Misfortune.
Now, mine is excellent.

440
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:44,173
Ah.

441
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:48,606
- A little mutton, my lady?
- I said I'm not hungry.

442
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,623
Why, so you did. I'd forgotten.

443
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:55,064
Well, you will let me know
if you regain your appetite, won't you?

444
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,540
Friends! Friends!

445
00:42:31,824 --> 00:42:35,453
I'd supposed, with you, that this Sir Guy
of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow...

446
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,016
...and a bitter enemy of ours.
And yet, look!

447
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,280
He provides us with this tasty supper.

448
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:48,120
And is this the end of his beneficence?
Why, no!

449
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:49,651
For in his train today...

450
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:53,592
...he's brought us half a score
of boxes full of jewels and silks...

451
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:58,924
...and more, about 30,000 golden marks
wrested from the northern shires.

452
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:02,169
- You wouldn't dare.
- Sit down!

453
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:06,163
Some of you might think our host...

454
00:43:06,402 --> 00:43:09,280
...intended this treasure
for the coffers of Prince John...

455
00:43:09,572 --> 00:43:12,370
...instead of to ransom the king.
And you would be right.

456
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:14,615
But a strange thing happened.

457
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:20,307
A change of heart overtook him in the
forest, and there it is, safe and sound!

458
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:28,473
- You speak of loyalty.
- Yes. Why not?

459
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:32,305
I suppose you and your cutthroats
intend to send this treasure to Richard?

460
00:43:32,635 --> 00:43:35,433
You wouldn't dream
of keeping it yourselves.

461
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:41,460
Friends! What shall we do with this
treasure? Divide it amongst ourselves?

462
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,278
- Hold it for Richard!
- It belongs to the king!

463
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:56,831
- Convinced?
- I may have been hasty...

464
00:43:57,663 --> 00:43:58,982
But why you, a knight...

465
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:02,994
...should live here like an animal,
robbing, killing, outlawed...?

466
00:44:03,335 --> 00:44:05,974
Are you really interested in learning
why I turned outlaw?

467
00:44:06,296 --> 00:44:08,730
Or are you afraid of the truth?
Or of me, perhaps?

468
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:11,980
I'm afraid of nothing. Least of all of you.

469
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,455
Good. Then come with me.

470
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:16,712
Oh, so you are afraid.

471
00:44:25,107 --> 00:44:27,223
Sit down! Sit down!

472
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,525
- Well, men.
- Hi!

473
00:44:45,126 --> 00:44:49,563
Hardly an inspiring sight
for such pretty eyes as yours, I'm sure.

474
00:44:50,382 --> 00:44:53,101
But these poor devils
have all had their homes burned.

475
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:56,537
Their families beaten and starved
to death by your tax gatherers.

476
00:44:56,847 --> 00:45:00,283
- Bless you. We'll never forget you.
- Our humble thanks, master.

477
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:03,832
- May we be worthy, Robin.
- You are, mother, you are.

478
00:45:04,146 --> 00:45:06,785
- Have you eaten well, friend?
- Yes, thanks, Robin Hood.

479
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:09,340
We humbly thank you, master.

480
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:14,777
I'm sorry to have to show you that.

481
00:45:15,032 --> 00:45:17,910
But once these poor people
were happy and contented.

482
00:45:18,201 --> 00:45:20,795
Just simple villagers
who never harmed a soul.

483
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:26,870
And now... Tortured, eyes put out,
tongues slit, ears hacked off.

484
00:45:28,085 --> 00:45:32,715
They come to me for protection
against your Norman friends.

485
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,200
But you've taken Norman lives.

486
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:39,347
Yes, those that deserved it.
The cruel and unjust.

487
00:45:40,097 --> 00:45:41,974
You're a strange man.

488
00:45:42,224 --> 00:45:45,853
Strange? Because I can feel for beaten,
helpless people?

489
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:49,065
No, you're strange because you want
to do something about it.

490
00:45:49,357 --> 00:45:52,554
You're willing to defy Sir Guy,
even Prince John himself.

491
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:54,055
To risk your own life.

492
00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:58,318
- And one of those men was a Norman.
- Norman or Saxon. What's that matter?

493
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:02,891
- It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.
- But it's lost you your rank, your lands.

494
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:04,680
It's made you a hunted outlaw...

495
00:46:04,914 --> 00:46:07,303
...when you might have
lived in comfort and security.

496
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:09,335
What's your reward for all this?

497
00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:14,576
Reward?
You just don't understand, do you?

498
00:46:15,966 --> 00:46:17,240
I'm sorry.

499
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:21,692
I do begin to see a little now.

500
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:27,299
If you do, then that's reward enough.

501
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:51,269
Now that you've robbed us and had your
fill of insulting us, we wish to leave.

502
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:53,657
- Come, Lady Marian.
- My men will escort my lady.

503
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:57,678
But before you leave, it might be well
if you thanked her for saving your life.

504
00:46:58,011 --> 00:46:59,205
My life?

505
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:01,545
Do you think you'd have
left this forest alive...

506
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:03,684
...if it hadn't been
for her presence here?

507
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:05,958
- Peter! Harold!
- Master?

508
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:09,302
Take six men and guide our loyal host
and his nervous friend...

509
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:13,314
...to the Nottingham Road.
- But our horses, our clothes.

510
00:47:13,652 --> 00:47:16,120
You'll return to Nottingham
as you are, on foot.

511
00:47:16,404 --> 00:47:19,999
This, Sir Guy, will at least be a lesson
to you in humility, if not in mercy.

512
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:23,123
- Your people will be returned tomorrow.
- But the lady Marian.

513
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:26,289
You'd best be started
before I have a change of mind.

514
00:47:28,665 --> 00:47:30,815
I think we'd better go.

515
00:47:37,341 --> 00:47:39,013
Now, my lady.

516
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:41,985
Friar Tuck! Little John!

517
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,216
Take the lady
to the Abbey of the Black Canons...

518
00:47:49,477 --> 00:47:52,116
...so tomorrow the bishop
can escort her the rest of the way.

519
00:47:52,398 --> 00:47:56,596
- Oh, master, may I go too?
- With your permission, my lady?

520
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:10,959
Goodbye, my lady.

521
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:12,930
Goodbye.

522
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,675
- He took everything you collected?
- Every silver penny.

523
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,512
And you two nincompoops sat there
and let him do it.

524
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:41,418
- Oh, we resisted as well as we could.
- Where are your wounds? Your bruises?

525
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:44,260
- And where are your men?
- What did Your Highness expect?

526
00:48:44,545 --> 00:48:47,662
With the Lady Marian in our company
and Locksley's men outnumbering us.

527
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:50,433
And not an arrow wound to divide
among them, I suppose.

528
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,791
And more than 30,000 marks
in the hands of that wolf's head.

529
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,694
That fellow's got to be taken.
Understand?

530
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:59,287
And how does Your Highness suggest
that he be taken?

531
00:48:59,564 --> 00:49:03,398
- If I may be so bold as to inquire?
- Mind your words, Gisbourne.

532
00:49:03,734 --> 00:49:06,965
You're fortunate not to be paying
for this with your head.

533
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:11,591
Your Highness, sir, I could muster
an army and surround Sherwood.

534
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:14,282
- You couldn't capture him...
- Mind your words.

535
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:16,731
...if he sat in your lap
shooting arrows at a crow.

536
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,748
Arrows! Arrows!

537
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:22,991
- He said shooting arrows at a crow.
- Take that silly looking bonnet off.

538
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:26,851
That stirs something in my mind.
Perhaps we can't take him by force.

539
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,130
He's too well protected. Knows
Sherwood's hidden paths well. But...

540
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,938
- But what?
- We'll outwit him.

541
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,008
We'll hold an archery tournament!

542
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,537
Archery tour...

543
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:39,916
And have him fly in on the end of one
of his own arrows? That's marvelous.

544
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,067
He's the finest archer in the North.
Think he'd forgo shooting...

545
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:46,871
...against the archers of all England?
We'll give a prize. Say, a golden arrow.

546
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:49,708
And ask him to risk his neck for that?

547
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,307
That won't be the only bait...

548
00:49:51,532 --> 00:49:54,205
...with the Lady Marian presenting
the arrow herself.

549
00:49:55,703 --> 00:49:56,852
What do you mean?

550
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,072
When they came out of the forest,
she seemed very friendly.

551
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,889
And didn't you notice
how his eyes never left her?

552
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:04,886
- Yes, yes, I noticed.
- Well, then!

553
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:08,246
- Well, then, how do we get word to him?
- Get word to Robin...

554
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:11,017
...who has an eye in every bush
and ears in every wall?

555
00:50:11,302 --> 00:50:13,497
But even if he comes,
won't he be disguised?

556
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:15,912
Whether he be dressed as priest,
beggar, knight...

557
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:19,332
...palmer, what disguise can conceal
the finest archer in England?

558
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:22,520
The man who wins the golden arrow
will be Robin Hood.

559
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:25,327
Will you take that bonnet off?

560
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:15,757
I hope our little golden hook
will catch the fish.

561
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:18,103
- You hope?
- Oh, it will if he's here.

562
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:22,601
If he's not, we'll stick your head
upon the target and shoot at that.

563
00:51:22,957 --> 00:51:24,709
- Are your men sure of their orders?
- Yes.

564
00:51:24,959 --> 00:51:28,349
They're stationed all around the field.
Even a worm couldn't get through.

565
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,228
You talk as if this were a trap.

566
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:36,221
No, my dear. Just a precaution in case
the Saxons create a disturbance.

567
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,150
By orders of His Highness Prince John...

568
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:46,632
...the champions
of Sir Guy and the knights...

569
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:51,216
...will be limited to three flights
of arrows for the eliminations.

570
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:55,562
The winning team will meet all comers.

571
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:19,604
- You know it's a trap.
- A golden arrow, from the lady herself.

572
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:23,198
- They've cooked this up to take you.
- Well, what of it?

573
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:26,430
- You know what'll happen if they do.
- Where's your sporting blood?

574
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:29,562
Sir Guy accepted our invitation.
We'd be rude not to accept his.

575
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:34,647
- It'd be ruder to get your neck stretched.
- There, my band getting fat and overfed.

576
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:37,099
Where's your love of fights,
risk, adventure?

577
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:41,517
Since our friend seems to have gone
a little mad, I'll have to see him through.

578
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:43,699
We'll have to see him through.

579
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,648
Prepare final flight.

580
00:53:03,643 --> 00:53:07,477
Does my lady find it interesting?
Lady Marian?

581
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:10,123
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I asked if you found it interesting.

582
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:13,948
Yes, very.
They're splendid archers.

583
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:16,552
You'll find it much more
interesting later on.

584
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:26,809
The winning team will compete
as individuals.

585
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:30,077
Captain Phillip of Arras.

586
00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:34,813
Elwyn the Welshman.
Matt of Sleaford.

587
00:53:35,173 --> 00:53:38,165
They now challenge all comers.

588
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:41,618
The men who'd shoot against that lot
have to have the eyes of a falcon.

589
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:44,238
They're far too good for me.
I'm not shooting today.

590
00:54:54,714 --> 00:54:57,990
Remaining archers will use
center target.

591
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:12,325
Matt of Sleaford, out!

592
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:15,237
Elwyn the Welshman, out!

593
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:24,489
- Ah! The tall tinker.
- Now is the time.

594
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:28,174
Not so hasty, Sir Guy. I'm enjoying
myself. Let them finish the match.

595
00:55:28,496 --> 00:55:31,533
- But he could...
- Have your men close in if you wish.

596
00:55:37,755 --> 00:55:38,983
Look.

597
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:41,523
Yeah, they're closing in.
I hope Robin sees them.

598
00:55:53,063 --> 00:55:55,861
I must commend Your Highness
for the subtlety of your scheme.

599
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:16,154
Very good. Would you say you'd seen
that tall fellow before?

600
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:19,658
And if I had, what interest
could a tinker have for me?

601
00:56:19,966 --> 00:56:22,082
Phillip of Arras shoots next.

602
00:56:25,888 --> 00:56:28,561
Tie!
You will be allowed another flight.

603
00:56:28,849 --> 00:56:33,684
Target's a deal too close. Can we have
it removed to a fit distance to shoot at?

604
00:56:35,982 --> 00:56:37,620
Another 20 paces!

605
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:43,716
If your archer captain
wins at that distance...

606
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:45,866
...I'll give you
1000 gold marks for him.

607
00:56:46,116 --> 00:56:49,074
Win or lose, I'll give him
to Your Highness for a favor.

608
00:56:49,704 --> 00:56:52,502
Provided you let me deal
with this wolf's head in my own way.

609
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:56,830
Done. I'm leaving for Norwich right
after the tournament anyway...

610
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,286
...so you may do what you please
with him.

611
00:57:03,676 --> 00:57:06,713
Why, he can't win now.
No living man could beat that shot.

612
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:10,051
I'll wager 100 marks on Phillip of Arras!

613
00:57:17,356 --> 00:57:18,994
He split Phillip's arrow.

614
00:57:20,151 --> 00:57:22,381
The tinker wins! He wins!

615
00:57:41,254 --> 00:57:45,042
- What is your name, archer?
- Godfrey of Sherwood, Your Highness.

616
00:57:45,383 --> 00:57:48,932
How is it that a tinker learned so well
the use of arms?

617
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:50,491
Even a peaceful tinker...

618
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:55,001
...must protect himself these days
from treachery and other things.

619
00:57:55,354 --> 00:57:58,073
It's earned you more
than you bargained for today.

620
00:57:59,274 --> 00:58:01,504
I pronounce you champion archer
of England.

621
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:06,645
From the gracious hand of Lady Marian
Fitzwalter, you'll receive your reward.

622
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:12,348
Advance.

623
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:26,752
I... Here is your prize, sir archer.

624
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:31,404
It's indeed an honor to receive it
from the hands of so beautiful a lady.

625
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:36,257
- How is it you didn't use a black arrow?
- That's my court of last resort, Sir Guy.

626
00:58:36,602 --> 00:58:39,958
- Its verdict is always final.
- Arrest this man!

627
00:59:26,277 --> 00:59:28,233
That's a good idea.

628
00:59:31,115 --> 00:59:32,787
You're a very rash young man.

629
00:59:33,035 --> 00:59:36,710
And I'm sorry I can't be in Nottingham to
see what Gisbourne has in store for you.

630
00:59:37,038 --> 00:59:39,916
- It'll be something special, I'm sure.
- I'm sure.

631
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,439
Sorry I underestimated you.
Next time perhaps...

632
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:45,179
There'll be no next time.
Take him away!

633
01:00:15,536 --> 01:00:19,529
"Robin of Locksley. Known to
some as the outlaw Robin Hood.

634
01:00:19,874 --> 01:00:22,991
After trial, in which you did not produce
one witness in your behalf...

635
01:00:23,296 --> 01:00:26,174
...you've been found guilty of outlawry,
murder, abduction...

636
01:00:26,465 --> 01:00:28,376
...false pretenses,
contempt of the Crown...

637
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:30,544
...poaching in forests
and high treason".

638
01:00:30,802 --> 01:00:32,633
Haven't you forgotten
a count or two?

639
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:36,377
Surely it's a crime under the noble
Prince John to love one's country.

640
01:00:36,682 --> 01:00:39,276
To protect serfs from injustice
and be loyal to one's king.

641
01:00:39,894 --> 01:00:44,410
If I could add anything to the charges
against you, I would most gladly do so.

642
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:48,289
"It is the sentence of this tribunal, on
the morrow at high noon you be taken...

643
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:52,605
...to the square in Nottingham and there
hanged by the neck until you are dead".

644
01:00:54,869 --> 01:00:58,498
There may be some who will regret
that a man of your peculiar talents...

645
01:00:58,831 --> 01:01:00,981
...should be cut off so early in life. But...

646
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:04,639
You think the sentence extremely
lenient. Thank you.

647
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,459
What's troubling you, my lady?
Is it the outlaw?

648
01:02:15,615 --> 01:02:20,052
Yes. I hate to see a human
being trapped...

649
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:24,094
Bess, you know where his men
may be found, don't you?

650
01:02:24,416 --> 01:02:26,725
- Why, my lady, how should I know?
- Don't put me off.

651
01:02:27,002 --> 01:02:29,835
That little man who liked you.
You've been seeing him?

652
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:31,848
- Yes, my lady.
- Tell me where.

653
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,320
- Do you want to send a message?
- To his men, yes.

654
01:02:34,593 --> 01:02:37,710
Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale
of a night, just now and again...

655
01:02:38,012 --> 01:02:41,641
...at a place in the town and I won't
deny as some of the others were there.

656
01:02:41,974 --> 01:02:45,808
Where was it?
Oh, Bess, please tell me!

657
01:02:46,479 --> 01:02:51,758
It was a tavern, my lady.
The Saracen's Head in Pilgrim Court.

658
01:02:52,153 --> 01:02:54,542
- The landlord's name is Humility Prin.
- Humility Prin.

659
01:02:54,823 --> 01:02:56,734
Knock at the door and say,
"A Locksley".

660
01:02:56,992 --> 01:02:58,505
- "A Locksley".
- Yes, but...

661
01:02:58,744 --> 01:03:00,302
Get me a cloak, quickly!

662
01:03:00,537 --> 01:03:03,210
Yes, madame. Oh, dear...

663
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:10,600
- But there must be some way...
- Couldn't we storm the place?

664
01:03:10,922 --> 01:03:13,914
Why, you'd need an army
with a battering ram to even dent it.

665
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:16,172
Aye, he'll be hanged for sure.

666
01:03:16,427 --> 01:03:18,065
Maybe Little John's right.
Perhaps we...

667
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,113
A Locksley.

668
01:03:36,237 --> 01:03:38,797
- What is it, Prin?
- A lady, sir. The Lady Marian.

669
01:03:39,074 --> 01:03:43,033
- What?
- It's a trap, Will. Watch those windows.

670
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:45,281
She has the password, all right.

671
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:47,575
- Is she alone?
- Yes, sir.

672
01:03:47,835 --> 01:03:49,393
Fetch her in.

673
01:04:04,726 --> 01:04:07,763
- What do you want, my lady?
- I want to help him.

674
01:04:08,063 --> 01:04:11,658
- How did you find us here?
- Never mind that now.

675
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,192
Please don't stand there staring.
Tell me what I can do.

676
01:04:16,488 --> 01:04:20,037
- Don't trust her. It's a trick.
- Would I come alone if it were a trap?

677
01:04:20,367 --> 01:04:22,801
What's to prevent your killing me if...?

678
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:25,070
Is there no one here
with sense enough to see?

679
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:26,843
One moment.

680
01:04:28,292 --> 01:04:31,682
We have to make sure, my child.
You're a good daughter of the church?

681
01:04:33,089 --> 01:04:35,603
You swear by Our Lady
that you want to help Robin?

682
01:04:35,882 --> 01:04:37,440
I swear, good Father.

683
01:04:37,926 --> 01:04:39,405
- Have you thought of a way?
- Yes.

684
01:04:39,636 --> 01:04:42,753
- Can you get us in the castle?
- That's no good. He's heavily guarded.

685
01:04:43,056 --> 01:04:44,853
But I thought of another way.
Listen.

686
01:05:15,464 --> 01:05:19,343
- This is a rare treat, isn't it, my lady?
- Yes, isn't it?

687
01:05:19,677 --> 01:05:22,316
With Locksley out of the way,
we'll stamp out the rest.

688
01:05:22,805 --> 01:05:26,559
Won't it be a pleasant surprise
for Prince John when he returns?

689
01:05:28,727 --> 01:05:32,845
To think that I was once foolish enough
to believe that you rather liked him.

690
01:05:33,315 --> 01:05:34,828
Why, your hand is trembling.

691
01:06:00,342 --> 01:06:03,015
We Saxons won't forget you,
Robin Hood!

692
01:06:15,274 --> 01:06:17,424
Take him to the gallows.

693
01:06:26,077 --> 01:06:27,305
Take him up there.

694
01:07:02,156 --> 01:07:05,626
He'll not be so insolent
when they've stretched his neck.

695
01:07:06,744 --> 01:07:08,462
Get ready.

696
01:07:23,926 --> 01:07:25,518
Stop him!

697
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:57,628
Stop! Guards!

698
01:08:10,224 --> 01:08:11,976
Friar Tuck! Much!

699
01:08:12,225 --> 01:08:14,420
- Here we are, sir!
- Here, safe and sound!

700
01:08:14,686 --> 01:08:16,244
Back to camp!

701
01:08:38,335 --> 01:08:40,530
Robin! Where are you?

702
01:08:41,797 --> 01:08:44,231
Here I am. Stand by!

703
01:09:29,345 --> 01:09:31,495
He is different
from anyone I've ever known.

704
01:09:31,764 --> 01:09:36,838
He's, well, he's brave and he's reckless,
and yet he's gentle and kind.

705
01:09:37,228 --> 01:09:38,980
He's not brutal like...

706
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:43,382
Tell me, when you are in love, is it...

707
01:09:43,735 --> 01:09:46,454
...well, is it hard to think of anybody
but one person?

708
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:49,458
Yes, indeed, and sometimes
there's a bit of trouble sleeping.

709
01:09:49,742 --> 01:09:52,302
I know,
but it's a nice kind of not sleeping.

710
01:09:52,578 --> 01:09:54,614
Yes, and it affects your appetite too.

711
01:09:54,872 --> 01:09:56,863
Not that I've noticed
it's done that to you...

712
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:59,002
...except when he was
waiting to be hanged.

713
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:01,446
Does it make you want
to be with him all the time?

714
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:05,785
Yes. And when he's with you,
your legs are weak as water.

715
01:10:06,133 --> 01:10:10,285
Tell me, my lady, when he looks at you,
do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...

716
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:14,595
...like goosy pimples running
all up and down your spine?

717
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:17,717
- Then there's not a doubt of it.
- Doubt of what?

718
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:19,810
That you're in love!

719
01:10:21,608 --> 01:10:23,644
What do you want?

720
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:25,762
Robin!

721
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:29,616
- I must say. I must say!
- Keep quiet, Bess.

722
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,860
Are you completely mad?

723
01:10:32,118 --> 01:10:33,949
- Why did you come here?
- To see you.

724
01:10:34,202 --> 01:10:35,601
But don't you realize that...?

725
01:10:35,829 --> 01:10:38,548
My men told me what you did for me,
so I've come to thank you.

726
01:10:38,832 --> 01:10:42,268
And after what I couldn't help
overhearing about that prickly feeling...

727
01:10:42,586 --> 01:10:43,905
...I'm very glad I did come.

728
01:10:44,129 --> 01:10:47,326
That was a game.
Now, you've got to go at once!

729
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:50,228
A game?
Well, couldn't I join in?

730
01:10:50,887 --> 01:10:54,846
Of course, I probably wouldn't be
as good at it as this pretty young girl.

731
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:58,038
But I could do my best.

732
01:10:58,269 --> 01:10:59,543
Bess, will you leave us?

733
01:11:01,272 --> 01:11:02,751
Please!

734
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:16,340
Now, let's see,
where does this game begin?

735
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:20,455
Oh, I know. It's simple.
We'll start where you're in love with me.

736
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:24,421
You are, aren't you?
Because I am with you, terribly.

737
01:11:24,753 --> 01:11:27,313
That's why I came.
I had to see you again.

738
01:11:27,589 --> 01:11:29,864
You must go at once.
And I don't love you.

739
01:11:30,133 --> 01:11:33,967
- Oh! Are you sure?
- Yes.

740
01:11:34,971 --> 01:11:37,565
Very well then, I'll go.

741
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:43,889
This is rather unfriendly of you,
exposing me to my enemies like this.

742
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:50,454
Let me see. There's a fat old captain
of the guard down there with bow legs.

743
01:11:50,821 --> 01:11:52,937
If I drop on him
that'll bend them out worse.

744
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,760
An archer! He's too thin.
I might miss him altogether.

745
01:11:56,036 --> 01:11:57,754
- Robin!
- The very thing.

746
01:11:57,995 --> 01:12:00,793
Five men-at-arms in a group.
They'll break the fall beautifully.

747
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:02,561
- Goodbye, my lady!
- Robin!

748
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:04,225
- Yes?
- Please.

749
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,132
Then you do love me? Don't you?

750
01:12:06,379 --> 01:12:08,290
- Don't you?
- You know I do.

751
01:12:08,548 --> 01:12:10,459
Well, that's different.

752
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,452
- Do you know you're very impudent?
- Me?

753
01:12:26,732 --> 01:12:27,721
You are!

754
01:12:27,942 --> 01:12:31,332
When my guardian, King Richard, finds
out about your being in love with me...

755
01:12:31,654 --> 01:12:33,884
- I know, he'll make me court jester.
- He won't!

756
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:36,146
He'll stick your funny head
on London Gate.

757
01:12:36,408 --> 01:12:39,002
And a fine decoration it will be,
my bold Norman beauty.

758
01:12:39,286 --> 01:12:41,117
- I'm not bold.
- Well, you're Norman.

759
01:12:41,372 --> 01:12:45,081
Well, I don't hold that against you.
And you are a beauty.

760
01:12:45,419 --> 01:12:47,774
- You're the most beautiful...
- You're leaving at once.

761
01:12:48,046 --> 01:12:50,799
Please, darling, every minute
you're here you're in danger.

762
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:52,206
I'll go.

763
01:12:52,426 --> 01:12:56,897
- Marian, will you come with me?
- To Sherwood?

764
01:12:57,264 --> 01:13:00,256
I've nothing to offer you but a life of
hardship and danger...

765
01:13:00,559 --> 01:13:01,833
...but we'd be together.

766
01:13:02,061 --> 01:13:05,133
- But, Robin, dear...
- It's asking a lot, but who knows...

767
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:07,669
...how long it'll be
before Richard returns.

768
01:13:07,942 --> 01:13:10,581
Friar Tuck could marry us. Will you?

769
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,010
Because I love you, Robin, I'd come.

770
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,748
Even the danger would mean nothing
if you were with me.

771
01:13:16,032 --> 01:13:17,147
Then you will?

772
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:20,996
No. Listen to me, darling. You
remember that day in Sherwood Forest?

773
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:24,799
I realized then for the first time
that what you were doing was right...

774
01:13:25,124 --> 01:13:26,318
...and that we were wrong.

775
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:27,736
No, let me finish.

776
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,554
You taught me England
is bigger than Normans and Saxons...

777
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,397
...fighting and hating each other.

778
01:13:32,633 --> 01:13:35,306
That it belongs to all of us,
to live peacefully together...

779
01:13:35,593 --> 01:13:37,390
...loyal only to Richard and to England.

780
01:13:37,637 --> 01:13:39,355
But, darling, you could help.

781
01:13:39,597 --> 01:13:42,350
I could help much more
by watching for treachery here...

782
01:13:42,642 --> 01:13:46,157
...and leaving you free to protect
Richard's people until he returns.

783
01:13:46,481 --> 01:13:49,757
Now do you see why
you have to go back to your men alone?

784
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:12,544
Go now, quickly, dearest.

785
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:16,382
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye.

786
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:35,772
- Goodbye, my love.
- Goodbye.

787
01:15:06,061 --> 01:15:10,179
- You gentlemen have traveled far?
- Yes, quite a distance.

788
01:15:10,524 --> 01:15:13,402
I'm sorry I can't give you better food.

789
01:15:15,028 --> 01:15:18,577
- There is little left to us these days.
- This will be enough.

790
01:15:18,907 --> 01:15:21,467
The inn at Luton was well supplied.
How is that?

791
01:15:21,868 --> 01:15:24,462
Ah. That's a Norman inn.

792
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:32,242
But it's an outrage!
I'll complain to Prince John.

793
01:15:32,544 --> 01:15:36,503
I'll have this rascal's ears,
no matter how. Dares to rob me!

794
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,558
Strip my person of jewels!

795
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,313
What's this country coming to...

796
01:15:40,552 --> 01:15:42,907
...when a churchman
can't travel the forest in safety?

797
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,217
- Who's he?
- The Bishop of the Black Canons.

798
01:15:46,518 --> 01:15:49,794
- Do you wish to go on after dinner?
- No. We can't reach the abbey tonight.

799
01:15:50,105 --> 01:15:52,221
- I'll stay. Tend to the horses.
- Yes, Your Grace.

800
01:15:52,482 --> 01:15:54,518
- Bring food to us!
- Yes, Your Grace, at once!

801
01:15:54,776 --> 01:15:58,246
It's no longer safe to journey anywhere.
Robbers at every turn of the road.

802
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:01,290
- What happened, Your Grace?
- I told you! We've been robbed.

803
01:16:01,575 --> 01:16:04,851
Not a chance to defend ourselves.
They burst on us from ambush.

804
01:16:05,162 --> 01:16:07,437
- Who did?
- Why, Robin Hood, of course.

805
01:16:07,706 --> 01:16:09,424
There's no other
with impudence enough.

806
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:11,496
Robin Hood again, sire.

807
01:16:14,295 --> 01:16:17,731
- You've heard of him, then?
- Oh, he seems well known hereabouts.

808
01:16:18,051 --> 01:16:23,728
- Oh, then you're strange to this shire?
- More or less.

809
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,971
What might be your names, gentlemen?

810
01:16:26,225 --> 01:16:28,864
They're hardly important enough
to deserve your interest.

811
01:16:29,145 --> 01:16:32,023
- Landlord, where's our ale?
- Coming, sirs.

812
01:16:32,314 --> 01:16:34,305
Will you gentlemen
be remaining here tonight?

813
01:16:34,566 --> 01:16:37,842
We hadn't decided, Your Grace.
What would you advise?

814
01:16:38,153 --> 01:16:42,146
Well, there's so much danger on
the road, you'd be far safer here.

815
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:46,120
We will then, since we'll have
the added pleasure of your company.

816
01:16:46,454 --> 01:16:51,369
I should like to stay, but I recollected
some urgent affairs at my abbey.

817
01:16:51,752 --> 01:16:54,391
Some other time, or perhaps you would
break your journey...

818
01:16:54,672 --> 01:16:57,061
...and sup with me tomorrow.
- Your Grace is too kind.

819
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,730
Then I bid you good evening, gentlemen,
and God speed you in the morning.

820
01:17:01,052 --> 01:17:02,929
Thank you. Good night.

821
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:12,328
The window!

822
01:17:16,525 --> 01:17:18,755
Are there beds prepared, landlord?

823
01:17:19,028 --> 01:17:22,577
Let's to sleep, then. I'm tired.

824
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:30,350
- I'm afraid he suspects, sire.
- I fear so.

825
01:17:30,664 --> 01:17:31,733
His Grace is a Norman.

826
01:17:31,957 --> 01:17:34,915
Did you see the fear on the
landlord's face when he came in?

827
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:38,042
I've seen it in the faces
of thousands since we returned.

828
01:17:38,338 --> 01:17:40,249
I ought never to have left England.

829
01:17:40,507 --> 01:17:42,543
I noticed when Robin Hood's
name is mentioned...

830
01:17:42,801 --> 01:17:44,598
The mysterious outlaw
whom we have sought.

831
01:17:44,846 --> 01:17:48,964
In vain. However, the bishop
didn't have any difficulty meeting him.

832
01:17:49,309 --> 01:17:50,628
Which gives me an idea.

833
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:54,504
- And you're sure it was Richard?
- No doubt of it.

834
01:17:54,773 --> 01:17:56,729
How like my dear brother this is!

835
01:17:56,983 --> 01:18:00,214
He couldn't rot in Durnstein
like any decent man.

836
01:18:01,946 --> 01:18:04,062
- But Richard has no army.
- No, Your Highness.

837
01:18:04,323 --> 01:18:07,872
- If he had, we should have heard of it.
- If my brother were to be killed...

838
01:18:08,201 --> 01:18:11,557
- England would have a new king.
- That would be murder! I'll have no part...

839
01:18:11,872 --> 01:18:15,467
You'll do as you're told! That's
very simple. Keep your mouth closed.

840
01:18:15,793 --> 01:18:17,067
Your Highness, I beg of you!

841
01:18:17,295 --> 01:18:21,049
How long will you retain your abbey
if Richard survives to find out...

842
01:18:21,381 --> 01:18:24,259
...what you've been up to
these years he's been away?

843
01:18:28,348 --> 01:18:30,987
Go on, Gisbourne. Who's to...?

844
01:18:31,268 --> 01:18:34,066
Dickon was a knight before
your brother hacked off his spurs...

845
01:18:34,353 --> 01:18:35,672
...over some little mischance.

846
01:18:35,896 --> 01:18:39,605
There's nothing he wouldn't do for
a king who'd restore him to rank.

847
01:18:42,278 --> 01:18:45,907
- You don't love my brother, I hear.
- I have little reason to, Your Highness.

848
01:18:46,242 --> 01:18:48,915
- You know this tavern?
- Yes.

849
01:18:49,204 --> 01:18:50,398
If Richard dies...

850
01:18:50,622 --> 01:18:55,252
Dickon returns to the roll of English
knights. Am I not right?

851
01:18:55,627 --> 01:18:59,336
With the manor and estate
of Robin of Locksley to support his rank.

852
01:18:59,672 --> 01:19:02,391
- When shall I start?
- Now. How many men will you need?

853
01:19:02,675 --> 01:19:05,473
I shall do it better alone, Your Highness.

854
01:19:05,761 --> 01:19:07,479
The sooner you're crowned king...

855
01:19:07,721 --> 01:19:11,760
The better for my friends?
You're a clever fellow, Gisbourne.

856
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,978
Thank you, Your Majesty.

857
01:19:16,021 --> 01:19:19,297
Return to your abbey and make
preparations to proclaim me king...

858
01:19:19,608 --> 01:19:22,361
...here in Nottingham,
the day after tomorrow.

859
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:36,746
Do you suppose she heard?

860
01:19:37,459 --> 01:19:38,938
I don't know.

861
01:19:47,846 --> 01:19:51,680
Now you know why Robin's got to find
King Richard at once and warn him.

862
01:19:52,017 --> 01:19:54,008
Take this note
to Much at Saracen's Head.

863
01:20:19,919 --> 01:20:22,274
My lady's hearing
is a little defective tonight.

864
01:20:22,547 --> 01:20:26,142
When you knock at a lady's door as
if it were a tavern, you deserve to wait.

865
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:27,787
You seem upset.

866
01:20:28,011 --> 01:20:29,967
Upset? Why should I be?

867
01:20:30,806 --> 01:20:34,845
Oh, come now, my dear Lady Marian.
You've played the innocent long enough.

868
01:20:35,184 --> 01:20:38,062
- Let's be frank with one another.
- I don't see the need.

869
01:20:38,354 --> 01:20:42,063
You're charming, but not exactly
clever. You couldn't have failed...

870
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,073
...to overhear what Prince John
and I were talking about.

871
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:47,830
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't trouble to deny it.

872
01:20:48,115 --> 01:20:52,791
And your first thought, as Richard's
loyal ward, was to warn him.

873
01:20:53,162 --> 01:20:56,313
- Am I not right?
- Why, how could I warn Richard?

874
01:20:56,624 --> 01:20:58,933
How did Locksley and his men
arrange his escape...

875
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:01,678
...from hanging after the archery match?

876
01:21:01,962 --> 01:21:04,760
Someone here in the castle
must have got word to him.

877
01:21:05,049 --> 01:21:06,448
That's ridiculous!

878
01:21:06,676 --> 01:21:09,236
When Richard's in danger,
what more natural...

879
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:12,787
...than that you should try
to warn him through Locksley?

880
01:21:13,098 --> 01:21:15,737
And you do intend to
warn him, don't you?

881
01:21:16,268 --> 01:21:19,101
- Don't you?
- No!

882
01:21:23,691 --> 01:21:26,524
If that's true, perhaps
you'd explain before Prince John...

883
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:29,379
...and the Court of Execution
the meaning of this.

884
01:21:30,865 --> 01:21:32,776
Guard!

885
01:21:38,372 --> 01:21:40,249
Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall.

886
01:22:10,905 --> 01:22:13,783
Not only has she consorted with
this Saxon rebel...

887
01:22:14,076 --> 01:22:18,274
...found guilty of outlawry, theft,
murder, abduction and high treason...

888
01:22:18,622 --> 01:22:22,331
...but she has betrayed
her own Norman people.

889
01:22:22,917 --> 01:22:25,670
Are you not ashamed, my Lady Marian?

890
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:31,142
Yes, I am. Bitterly. But it's a shame
that I'm a Norman...

891
01:22:31,508 --> 01:22:34,864
...after seeing the things my fellow
countrymen have done to England.

892
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:39,093
At first I wouldn't believe. Because I was
a Norman I wouldn't let myself believe...

893
01:22:39,476 --> 01:22:42,195
...that the horrors you inflicted
on the Saxons weren't just.

894
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:46,154
I know now why you tried so hard
to kill this outlaw whom you despised.

895
01:22:46,484 --> 01:22:49,601
It's because he was the one man
in England who protected the helpless...

896
01:22:49,904 --> 01:22:51,622
...against beasts
drunk on human blood!

897
01:22:51,864 --> 01:22:54,856
And now you intend
to murder your own brother!

898
01:22:55,285 --> 01:22:57,276
You'll be sorry you interfered.

899
01:22:57,537 --> 01:23:00,574
Sorry? I'd do it again if you kill me for it.

900
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:06,907
A prophetic speech, my lady, for that is
exactly what is going to happen to you.

901
01:23:08,339 --> 01:23:10,978
You wouldn't dare.

902
01:23:11,258 --> 01:23:14,887
I'm the royal ward of King Richard
and no one but the king himself...

903
01:23:15,221 --> 01:23:17,530
...has the right to condemn me to death.

904
01:23:18,557 --> 01:23:20,513
You are quite right, my dear.

905
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:25,045
And it shall be a king who will order
your execution for high treason...

906
01:23:25,398 --> 01:23:28,470
...exactly 48 hours from now.

907
01:23:29,402 --> 01:23:30,881
Take her away.

908
01:23:35,073 --> 01:23:38,065
- You got it all in your stupid head now?
- Of course I have.

909
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:41,326
Well, give Robin the whole message
exactly like I told it to you.

910
01:23:41,622 --> 01:23:44,580
Bess, where was Dickon
supposed to find King Richard?

911
01:23:44,877 --> 01:23:46,196
Oh, never mind him!

912
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,980
What do I care about
your kings and thrones and such?

913
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,851
Robin has gotta do something
to save my baby!

914
01:23:52,134 --> 01:23:55,285
Come on, old girl.
Robin will look after her, all right.

915
01:23:55,595 --> 01:23:57,984
- Where's Dickon heading for?
- Kent Road Tavern.

916
01:23:58,265 --> 01:23:59,414
Kent Road Tavern?

917
01:23:59,641 --> 01:24:02,235
You can save three miles
and cut him off through Low Wood.

918
01:24:02,519 --> 01:24:05,317
Come on, lass,
give us a kiss and wish me luck.

919
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,352
Hurry up and take
your ugly face out of here.

920
01:24:10,651 --> 01:24:13,643
Oh, Much.
Oh, you will be careful, won't you?

921
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:15,984
Of course I will.

922
01:25:34,569 --> 01:25:36,844
Greetings, sir abbot!

923
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:51,265
- You've traveled far this morning?
- Too far to be patient with delay now.

924
01:25:51,588 --> 01:25:55,376
Perhaps it's the weight of your purse
that wearies you. I can remedy that.

925
01:25:55,716 --> 01:25:59,789
If it weighs more than a just amount I'll
share it with those who have less.

926
01:26:00,137 --> 01:26:02,935
You think I hand my purse
to every rough lout who asks for it?

927
01:26:10,814 --> 01:26:12,167
You see, sir abbot?

928
01:26:12,401 --> 01:26:15,279
We're poor outlaws,
with nothing to eat but the king's deer...

929
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:19,325
...while you have property,
rents, and silver. So your purse!

930
01:26:19,657 --> 01:26:22,455
I traveled far on the king's business.
The silver I have left...

931
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,223
...equals no more than 60 marks.

932
01:26:24,454 --> 01:26:27,605
What? Are you
friendly to our good King Richard?

933
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:30,107
I love no man better.

934
01:26:30,334 --> 01:26:32,131
By that speech
you save half your money.

935
01:26:32,378 --> 01:26:34,733
Give me 30 marks for the poor.
The rest you may keep.

936
01:26:35,005 --> 01:26:36,040
Then I can go free?

937
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:38,646
Any friend of Richard's
is free of this forest.

938
01:26:38,926 --> 01:26:41,156
Would you honor us
by sharing meat with us?

939
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,227
- Gladly.
- Then come.

940
01:26:50,648 --> 01:26:54,641
- Well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?
- I'm called Robin Hood.

941
01:26:54,985 --> 01:26:56,543
It seems I've heard of you.

942
01:26:56,779 --> 01:26:59,896
- Nothing good, I hope.
- Oh, now I remember!

943
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:02,918
How does your loyalty
to Richard set on a killer of knights...

944
01:27:03,202 --> 01:27:05,352
...a poacher of the king's deer
and an outlaw?

945
01:27:05,621 --> 01:27:08,738
Those I kill died from misusing
the trust that Richard left them.

946
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,508
And the worst rogue of these
is the king's own brother.

947
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:14,307
- Oh, then you blame Prince John.
- No, I blame Richard.

948
01:27:14,588 --> 01:27:16,499
His task was defending his people...

949
01:27:16,756 --> 01:27:19,190
...instead of deserting them
to fight in foreign lands.

950
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:20,900
What?
You'd condemn Holy Crusades?

951
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:24,047
I'll condemn anything that leaves
the task of holding England...

952
01:27:24,347 --> 01:27:25,746
...to outlaws like me.

953
01:27:36,234 --> 01:27:37,906
Much!

954
01:27:42,992 --> 01:27:46,541
- Much, what's happened to you?
- Take me to Robin, quick!

955
01:28:08,599 --> 01:28:11,636
- Much, what's happened?
- King Richard's in England. In Sherwood!

956
01:28:11,937 --> 01:28:13,052
What?

957
01:28:13,272 --> 01:28:16,867
Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road
Tavern last night to kill the king.

958
01:28:17,192 --> 01:28:20,309
- Take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern...
- No need, master, no need.

959
01:28:20,612 --> 01:28:24,321
I headed Dickon off.
He ain't gonna murder no one no more.

960
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,875
- But the king? Where is he?
- I don't know, master.

961
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:32,138
Men, Richard must be found.

962
01:28:32,415 --> 01:28:33,973
He must be brought here for safety.

963
01:28:34,209 --> 01:28:36,279
Little John, take a party
and scour the country.

964
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:39,980
Friar Tuck, into the town.
Will, search every inn and cottage.

965
01:28:40,298 --> 01:28:42,971
Don't rest, day or night,
until he's found. Understand?

966
01:28:43,262 --> 01:28:46,174
You don't need to
search for Richard, Robin.

967
01:28:46,473 --> 01:28:48,668
He's in good hands. The best in England.

968
01:28:48,934 --> 01:28:50,811
What do you mean? Where is he?

969
01:28:51,061 --> 01:28:52,619
Here!

970
01:28:59,569 --> 01:29:01,321
Sire.

971
01:29:13,667 --> 01:29:16,340
All these have remained loyal.

972
01:29:16,628 --> 01:29:18,778
Rise, Sir Robin.

973
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:21,313
Rise, men of Sherwood.

974
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,860
Sire, Prince John's calling
Bishop of the Black Canons...

975
01:29:25,136 --> 01:29:27,172
...to proclaim him king
in Nottingham tomorrow.

976
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:29,819
- How'd you learn this?
- Lady Marian. She overheard.

977
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:31,736
They've taken her for treason.

978
01:29:31,976 --> 01:29:34,536
She's been condemned
to the block for warning us.

979
01:29:34,812 --> 01:29:36,689
He wouldn't dare
execute the king's ward.

980
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:37,929
You underestimate him.

981
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:40,424
To save her and your throne,
we've got to act now!

982
01:29:40,693 --> 01:29:42,046
By attacking Nottingham castle?

983
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:45,351
Without an army it'll be much
too strong. Your men will be killed.

984
01:29:45,658 --> 01:29:48,889
If the Bishop of the Black Canons
is performing the ceremony tomorrow...

985
01:29:49,203 --> 01:29:51,319
...suppose we visit him
at his abbey tonight...

986
01:29:51,581 --> 01:29:53,458
...and persuade him to suggest a way.

987
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,710
Brace up. Smile!

988
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:21,742
Wider!

989
01:30:22,027 --> 01:30:24,905
Still sure it wasn't you who
warned my brother I was in England?

990
01:30:25,197 --> 01:30:26,755
Why, sire, believe me, I...

991
01:30:26,991 --> 01:30:29,551
Your Grace, smile!

992
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:32,605
You'll sweat the lard
off your fat carcass...

993
01:30:32,871 --> 01:30:34,782
...before this day's over,
my pudgy friend.

994
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:38,749
And I hope some Norman sword
whittles you down to size!

995
01:30:50,975 --> 01:30:52,772
Oh, Lord, we beseech thee.

996
01:30:53,017 --> 01:30:56,692
Sanctify this thy servant,
our royal Prince John.

997
01:30:57,021 --> 01:31:02,175
Enrich his noble heart and bestow
upon him all princely virtues.

998
01:31:02,569 --> 01:31:04,241
Amen.

999
01:31:04,487 --> 01:31:06,079
No news of Richard.

1000
01:31:06,322 --> 01:31:07,994
No. None, Your Highness.

1001
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,639
Then Dickon must have...

1002
01:31:09,867 --> 01:31:12,256
Sir Dickon, Your Highness.

1003
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,350
Of course. Of course.

1004
01:31:19,876 --> 01:31:23,471
We are ready for the ceremony,
Your Majesty.

1005
01:33:41,271 --> 01:33:43,102
Remember.

1006
01:33:48,945 --> 01:33:52,142
By what authority do you,
John Lackland, Prince of England...

1007
01:33:52,448 --> 01:33:55,724
...claim to be crowned this day,
sovereign of the realm...

1008
01:33:56,035 --> 01:33:59,789
...and as defender of the Holy Sepulcher,
to receive the blessing of the church?

1009
01:34:00,122 --> 01:34:03,717
By right of blood succession.
According to the law of the realm.

1010
01:34:04,042 --> 01:34:06,875
Is it of your own free will
that you thus depose your brother...

1011
01:34:07,171 --> 01:34:08,809
...Richard the Lion-Heart of England?

1012
01:34:09,048 --> 01:34:11,004
Richard no longer exists!

1013
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:14,058
From this moment forward,
I, John, am king of England!

1014
01:34:15,306 --> 01:34:17,297
Aren't you a little premature, brother?

1015
01:34:17,557 --> 01:34:19,912
Richard! The Lion-Heart!

1016
01:34:20,185 --> 01:34:22,176
He's lying! He's an imposter!

1017
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,750
- The king lives!
- Men of Sherwood!

1018
01:34:26,608 --> 01:34:27,597
Robin Hood!

1019
01:34:27,817 --> 01:34:30,206
It's a trick of the outlaws!
Kill him! Seize him!

1020
01:35:56,948 --> 01:35:58,347
Did I upset your plans?

1021
01:35:58,575 --> 01:36:00,327
You've come to Nottingham
once too often!

1022
01:36:00,577 --> 01:36:03,569
When this is over, there'll be
no need for me to come again.

1023
01:36:14,509 --> 01:36:16,420
Your sword, Gisbourne.

1024
01:36:35,529 --> 01:36:37,997
- Know any prayers, my friend?
- I'll say one for you!

1025
01:38:25,849 --> 01:38:27,362
Save yourself, Robin!

1026
01:38:33,063 --> 01:38:37,181
The door, quick!
Quick, or I'll trim that beard for you!

1027
01:39:14,981 --> 01:39:17,654
But, Richard, Richard! I thought...

1028
01:39:17,943 --> 01:39:20,298
- You thought I was murdered!
- Oh, no, no.

1029
01:39:21,112 --> 01:39:25,105
I didn't mean to...
After all, Richard, I am your brother.

1030
01:39:25,450 --> 01:39:27,680
Yes, sire, he is your brother.

1031
01:39:27,952 --> 01:39:29,180
Yes, my brother.

1032
01:39:29,413 --> 01:39:32,723
I could forgive you if your treachery
were against me and not my subjects.

1033
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:36,511
I banish you and your followers from
England for the remainder of my lifetime.

1034
01:39:36,837 --> 01:39:39,192
Take them away.
See that they leave England.

1035
01:39:39,466 --> 01:39:42,902
I further banish from my realm
all injustices and oppressions...

1036
01:39:43,219 --> 01:39:46,097
...which have burdened my people.
And I pray that under my rule...

1037
01:39:46,389 --> 01:39:49,620
...Normans and Saxons alike
will share the rights of Englishmen.

1038
01:39:49,936 --> 01:39:52,496
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!

1039
01:39:53,438 --> 01:39:55,633
What about you, Robin?

1040
01:39:59,945 --> 01:40:02,379
My sword is yours,
sire, now and always.

1041
01:40:02,655 --> 01:40:04,486
Is there nothing I
can grant the outlaw...

1042
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:06,617
...who showed him
his duty to his country?

1043
01:40:06,868 --> 01:40:09,666
Yes, Your Majesty,
a pardon for the men of Sherwood.

1044
01:40:09,955 --> 01:40:11,911
Granted with all my heart.

1045
01:40:12,166 --> 01:40:14,634
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!

1046
01:40:15,418 --> 01:40:18,216
But is there nothing for yourself?

1047
01:40:19,839 --> 01:40:22,114
There's but one thing else, sire.

1048
01:40:23,426 --> 01:40:25,257
And do you too wish...?

1049
01:40:26,096 --> 01:40:28,485
More than anything in the world, sire.

1050
01:40:29,598 --> 01:40:30,826
Kneel, Robin Hood.

1051
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:37,626
Arise, Robin, Baron of Locksley,
Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham...

1052
01:40:38,107 --> 01:40:40,860
...and lord of all the lands and manors
appertaining thereto.

1053
01:40:41,154 --> 01:40:43,622
My first command to you, my lord earl...

1054
01:40:43,906 --> 01:40:47,103
...is to take in marriage
the hand of the Lady Marian.

1055
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:51,847
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live Robin Hood!

1056
01:40:52,206 --> 01:40:53,878
Long live Lady Marian!

1057
01:40:54,124 --> 01:40:56,240
And what say you to that,
Baron of Locksley?

1058
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:07,190
May I obey all your commands
with equal pleasure, sire!
