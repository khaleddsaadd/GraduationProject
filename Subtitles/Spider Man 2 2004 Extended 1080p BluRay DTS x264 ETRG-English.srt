1
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,798
Hey, Man, stop! Wait!

2
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,394
Wait! Stop! We have
to re-tie the cords.

3
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,471
We have to get out of here!

4
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,149
He's bleeding.
The female is unconscious.

5
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,719
I insist!

6
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,713
Come on, let's go!

7
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,151
Move!

8
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,632
Hello, my little beauty.

9
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,717
The whole world's been looking
for you and I found you.

10
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,552
I'm going to call you "America".

11
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,154
You are my America
and by God...

12
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,958
I'm your Christopher Columbus.

13
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,755
Leave him!

14
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,029
Let him go!

15
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,874
Don't shoot!

16
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,500
My dear friends...

17
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,590
I can relate great news.

18
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,276
We have two of the savages:
A male and a female.

19
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,997
The male has tried
to kill me...

20
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,437
and he's the most ferocious
fighter, by I've survived.

21
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,911
The other africans recoil
from our savages in fear.

22
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,635
They called them
"Spirits of the forest"...

23
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,599
and believe they can wreak
much evil magic.

24
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,672
- Why you leaving us?
- My work here is finished.

25
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,555
But this is your country.
You live here.

26
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,955
- My home is across the sea, sir.
- Your lord is here. He die here.

27
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,910
That is true and I'll carry
his memory in my heart. Always.

28
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,359
Why is it you want
with small men?

29
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,317
- I'll take them to my country.
- Why not take me?

30
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,357
Your wives would miss you
too much, sir.

31
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,040
You must take my men.
They big men.

32
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,711
I need to take pygmies.
I will study them, sir.

33
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,754
For why?

34
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,309
Because... all men on earth,
I believe, come from them.

35
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,313
But you're a white man.
These are black.

36
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,632
That is what the Doctor believes
if he's right he'll be famous.

37
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,274
What is famous?

38
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,270
Everybody in the whole
world will know who he is.

39
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,388
You want to be a king?
You take one little man...

40
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,678
one little woman to your
country and you king also!

41
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,353
- Is this why you go with him?
- No, sir.

42
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,398
So he give you plenty money.

43
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,191
Go to forest, take two little
people. Two of my men die.

44
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,708
You pay me!

45
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,112
Shall I have this loaded, Madam?

46
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,239
They don't belong to me anymore.
I'd given them to the King!

47
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,917
I think we should get the
birds on the next. Thank you.

48
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,952
We make sail in a few days. Our
ship awaits its precious cargo.

49
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,348
The two pygmies are safe and
well and I am healing fast.

50
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,311
The prospect of what lies before
us fills me with an excitement.

51
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,588
Our dreams are close
to being realised.

52
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,754
I don't understand!
What is he saying?

53
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,398
The pygmies would put
a curse on you.

54
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,038
They won't survive
outside their world.

55
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,959
At least we'll have their
bodies to study.

56
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,792
Aren't you gonna tell him
what I said?

57
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,959
Move yourselves!

58
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,472
Don't just lie there!
Move your legs!

59
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,069
Move! Get up!
Exercise!

60
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,192
Doctor! Leave them alone!

61
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,637
Stand up! Move your arms!

62
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,876
You'd be better talking
to the monkeys!

63
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,112
I'd be better off without you.

64
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,276
Come on, eat!
Amd you my lovely, you to eat.

65
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,868
Calm down.

66
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,195
Stop now!

67
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,911
Hey, back away! Now!

68
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,948
I've listed the pygmies as
a kind of anthropodial monkey.

69
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,959
We don't want to be taken
for slave traders.

70
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,838
I don't want to take any risks
but you're becoming the risk.

71
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,115
Let Zachary deal with,
he knows what is doing.

72
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,710
Thery are my responsibility.

73
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,039
They're my responsibility and
I don't want you going down.

74
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,869
I don't take orders!
Especially not from you!

75
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,832
Call it a "suggestion". I've
made this journey many times.

76
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,237
This is just a business venture
for you but for me...

77
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,470
it's probable these creatures
existed on earth before man.

78
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,309
At as other species were
becoming extinct, they survived.

79
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,555
There could be more at stake
than just the origin of man.

80
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,070
We could be talking
about the origin of all life!

81
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,958
I won't let a trader in wild
animals divert me.

82
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,110
You're forbidden to get down
to the hold.

83
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,430
My dear friends, a fever
has laid me low.

84
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,709
I suspect malaria so have kept
myself away from the pygmies.

85
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,190
I worry for them, in my absence,
but I dare not risk contagion.

86
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,230
We pass through ever
stormier seas.

87
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,870
Doctor! Come quick!

88
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,469
I see... yes.

89
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,953
I understand.

90
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,193
It's me you wanted.

91
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,513
Well here I am.

92
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,632
My name is Jamie.

93
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,037
We're friends now.

94
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,674
Friends.

95
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,395
Don't!

96
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,348
Back away!

97
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,478
When are you going to learn?
You're who captured them!

98
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,678
They'll never forget. Never!

99
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,157
It's from Jamie.
Posted from Lisbon.

100
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,677
The ship docks
in a matter of days.

101
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
"My friends, there have been
serious problems...

102
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,911
difficulties, constraints...
I advise caution.

103
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,439
My fever enforces brevity.

104
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,670
We must struggle to...
He doesn't even sign it.

105
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,393
- Look at his handwriting.
- He must be very ill.

106
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,708
It's not like him.

107
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,152
As if he deranged.

108
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,879
- Let me stay.
- That's impossible, my darling.

109
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,549
- I should be by your side.
- Abigail, you promised.

110
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,317
Why? I'll stay in our bedroom.

111
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,596
- I am not leaving.
- Yes you are!

112
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,594
My sweet, dear,
very obstinate little sister.

113
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,828
Fraser won't do a stroke of
a work if you're here.

114
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,119
We have two months to present
our paper to Academy.

115
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,713
A coach will take you
to Edinburgh at noon.

116
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,793
You send Jamie on this adventure
cause he's got nothing to lose.

117
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,518
You can't treat me like that.
I'm staying with my husband!

118
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,268
I'm frightened.

119
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,230
I have a bad feeling.

120
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,835
I always thought your idea
was insane.

121
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,678
Our research will be a huge
significance to the world.

122
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,633
If only you knew how I prayed
that Jamie would fail.

123
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,509
I just keep thinking...
What if they're dead?

124
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,191
Here is our eagle how
quite she is a lioness.

125
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,272
Some parrots, the monkeys.

126
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,790
Don't go too close to the
apes, they can be vicious.

127
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,037
The Cheetah and
the sweet litlle wart hog.

128
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,194
- Very good, madam.
- When should I get the document?

129
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,755
We'll have to go through
a regulation.

130
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,037
- The zoo is expecting them.
- I do my best.

131
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,956
Now the real work begins.
My little fellow.

132
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,510
Don't worry,
I'll keeping my distance.

133
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,155
- Jamie!
- Alexander! Fraser!

134
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,472
- You look well traveled, Jamie.
- That I... certainly am!

135
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,039
My friends, if you had any idea
how much I've thought of you.

136
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,308
There were days when I thought
I'd never see you again.

137
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,353
Is everything all right?

138
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,439
They're still alive?

139
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,391
Thank God
they are still alive!

140
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,316
I can't believe it.
Are they in good condition?

141
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,391
Please tell me how I can sell
something which I don't own?

142
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,632
These pygmies belong
to King Mateke Seko...

143
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,715
who has given me the concession
for the whole of Europe.

144
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,436
I am prepared to place them
at your disposal for 3 months.

145
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,993
As if they were for hire?

146
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,989
The fee for the expedition
included delivery of savages.

147
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,999
They belong to us!

148
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,789
No one outside Africa
can "own" these pygmies.

149
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,948
This is called slavery.

150
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,753
Do you think we can trust
Madame Van den Ende?

151
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,714
As long as we're all working
for our mutual benefit, we can.

152
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,637
Then we are agreed.

153
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,992
I'll have the papers drawn up.
I congratulate Dr Dodd.

154
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,397
Without him this expedition
would never have succeeded.

155
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,597
Let us through!

156
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,391
I never dreamt I'd live
to see this. Incredible.

157
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,834
You're right, Jamie.
It is our America.

158
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,314
Our "guests" are savages
from the jungles of Africa.

159
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,318
Very dangerous.
They are also cannibals.

160
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,513
We don't know what strange
diseases they may be carrying.

161
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,957
So keep away
and you'll be perfectly safe.

162
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,876
Bring provisions and water to
the mill, and we'd distribute.

163
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,836
Mr McBride, Dr Dodd and I, will
be the only people they'll see.

164
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,879
No one must know about them
till we present them to Academy.

165
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,831
But what about you
and the others, sir?

166
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,348
The pursuit of knowledge
entails certain risks.

167
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,194
But don't you worry, we'll
be taking every precaution.

168
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,195
- Is everything all right?
- All well sir.

169
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,356
- Did they sleep at all?
- One at time.

170
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,756
- Did you see them fornicate?
- Fornicate? Why?

171
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,910
Curiosity.
Scientific curiosity.

172
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,910
- Is the female the mate of male?
- Not as far as I'm aware.

173
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,478
I haven't the faintest idea
what they are to each other.

174
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,193
They probably think we'll
attack them if they both sleep.

175
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,435
Or they're waiting
for a chance to attack us.

176
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,919
- What are they doing?
- They're exercising.

177
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,959
Fascinating!

178
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,959
America! Stop!

179
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,356
Stop, America!

180
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,675
Fraser, on you go.

181
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,519
That's it!

182
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,152
Fraser, get out!

183
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,432
Back! America stop!

184
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,436
Open the door!
Fraser get to the door! Out!

185
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,079
Breathe! Breathe!

186
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,592
I'm not finished with you...
not by a long way.

187
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,388
Heaven breathe!

188
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,111
Something you need me for,
Mr Duncan?

189
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,799
I was worried. We heard
shots coming from the mill.

190
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,031
Yes, we did fire some shots.
And you know why, Mr Duncan?

191
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,069
We're studying the degree of
emotion our little savages...

192
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,517
might display. It's most
instructive. Good day.

193
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,508
Jamie...

194
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,434
Toko...

195
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,149
Come on, there is
nothing to lose.

196
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,718
"Thre blind mice,
see how they run...

197
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,758
Run after the farmer's wife and
cut off the tails with a knife

198
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,152
QA to AB, 83 degrees.

199
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,118
Facial line 9 and
one quarter inches.

200
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,032
QA to AB, 62 degrees.

201
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:48,238
Facial line,
7 and 2/5.

202
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,591
Facial projection, 108.

203
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,631
Cerebral projection, 87...

204
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,635
No it's right.
62 degrees!

205
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,512
The great apes are almost
always below 50 degrees.

206
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,509
Negroes, usualy above 70.
Mongols between 73 and 77...

207
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,029
and you Jamie, the perfect
caucasian at 83.

208
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,949
Which would seem to place our
pygmies right in the middle.

209
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,476
Between the most evolved apes
and the least developed humans.

210
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,156
You know what this implies?

211
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,359
How certain are you?

212
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,868
- Results point in one direction.
- We can't afford to be wrong.

213
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,510
I've checked and checked again.

214
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,959
My God!

215
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,677
It looks like the world is gonna
have to come to terms with...

216
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,269
the fact that Adam and Eve were
a little black man and woman.

217
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,193
They're gonna have to
repaint the Sistine Chapel.

218
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,190
When you left them alone they
didn't seem troubled in any way?

219
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,710
No, they weren't "troubled".
Wrong vocabulary, my fellow.

220
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,995
That would require intelligence
and a capacity for reflection.

221
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,434
Our couple are thousands
of years away from all that.

222
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,829
Pull up there!

223
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,198
Who gave you the permission
to come in here?

224
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,954
No one! But I assumed you're
not going to turn me away.

225
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,029
If you succeed, then
you'll be forgiven...

226
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,915
until then we'll have to ensure
we have the proper documents.

227
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,993
I understand.

228
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,478
Toko "Ambaka" for the man.
What do you think?

229
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,910
And do you know the name
of the girl?

230
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,436
You... just invent something.

231
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,511
Wouli Djem. And the age is?

232
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,790
Say 20 for him
18 for her.

233
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,678
You'd better fill in the rest.

234
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,678
So, our guests are Toko Ambaka
and Wouli Djem.

235
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,798
In the province of Oubangui in
the territory of King Mateke.

236
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,434
They have come to Scotland at
the ivitation or Royal Academy.

237
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,750
I need a letter of confirmation
from the Academy.

238
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,679
Consider it done.

239
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,030
I hereby certify that both
of the said individuals...

240
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,989
are placed under my authority
for a period of three months.

241
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,792
Please sign.

242
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,433
May I see them?

243
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,190
Madame... would you join me?
It's safe now.

244
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,633
We don't have much time.

245
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,116
Madame, considering you're here,
it'd be most helpful...

246
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,392
I don't think any of us should...

247
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,477
I see. What shall I say?
It's very delicate.

248
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,316
- It would seem something of...
- Of a violation?

249
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,919
Very well.

250
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,279
I think you should leave!

251
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,598
She's most definitely a woman.

252
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,833
What are these for?

253
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,510
Fill this with lead shot and we
can tell exactly the volume...

254
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,435
of the cranium. We can measure
the size of their brains.

255
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,553
She's waking.

256
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,268
Good, yes, I have it.

257
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,839
Careful.

258
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,879
Be calm.

259
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,429
Hold her!

260
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,958
- What are you doing?
- She sees her own death!

261
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,155
She thinks her soul is being
taken from her.

262
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,951
She would have killed herself.

263
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,833
Have you seen them?

264
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,272
No, but I could hear the most
awful cries. Not human cries.

265
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,833
And it wasn't the first time.
We got to get them out of here.

266
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,828
They bring evil.
They got evil powers.

267
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,230
This is nonesense. What evil
have they done to you?

268
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,592
My child has raging fever,
three days now.

269
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,310
My cattle are maddened, they
don't sleep at night.

270
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,712
That's the moon... everyone
knows that. You can't...

271
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,678
Mr Auchinleck's not the same.
He's like a man possessed...

272
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,119
and we should deliver him
from his possession!

273
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,273
Go up and get Mr Auchinleck.
Douglas, you come with me.

274
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,472
It's an asthma attack.
He could die...

275
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,359
Quickly!

276
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,918
Bring me the lamp and
hold his head up!

277
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,319
Hold his head!

278
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,959
Bastard!

279
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,956
You give that here,
black buggers.

280
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,472
Too late, sir. And so were we.

281
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,673
Clear the way!

282
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,712
Move aside, I say!

283
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,069
Douglas is dead, sir.
The savages killed him.

284
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,638
God bless his soul.

285
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,360
Spread out... you go
in small groups.

286
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,757
Do not hurt them on any
account. I want them alive.

287
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,238
Any man who harms them
will answer to me.

288
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,232
- Lf they're seen as animals...
- But if they're human being?

289
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,789
Then, they are murderers.
Our work is over.

290
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,878
- We must find them first.
- Follow the trail fast.

291
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,797
Madame, We'll go
around the forest.

292
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,153
Come on lads. Let's get
these savages!

293
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,553
Are you following?

294
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,154
I'll be there!

295
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,554
Fine, I have him.

296
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,869
Best leave it to us, Dr Dodd.
We know what to do.

297
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,119
Damn you!

298
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,832
The dogs are gone at six.
They must be close!

299
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,798
Oh Jesus Christ!

300
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,117
Put your weapons down!
Keep back the dogs!

301
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,231
We can take them in charge!

302
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,710
They killed Douglas!
The attacked Mr McBride!

303
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,911
It was an accident.
It was nobody fault.

304
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,038
It was a terrible accident.

305
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,630
Take them back to
the police, sir.

306
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,634
- I will kill him!
- Stay there man!

307
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,310
Jamie, stop!

308
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,795
Shut up! Shut up!

309
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,196
Shut up! Shut up!

310
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,159
You did it.

311
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,719
Did what?

312
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,713
In the struggle,
you had the gun.

313
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,399
It went off by accident.
Douglas hit it.

314
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,158
Alexander, what are you saying?

315
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,592
It was a tragic accident.
Manslaughter.

316
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,150
- Are you out of your mind?
- No one will blame you.

317
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,359
But the pygmies
have to be innocent.

318
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,438
You want me to confess
to a crime I didn't commit?

319
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,114
Yes! It was your stupidity
that landed us here.

320
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,117
I might go to prison.

321
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,470
Not for an accident.

322
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,236
The inquest will be a formality.

323
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,398
Just think,
think what's take here.

324
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,476
Please, Fraser,
this is our only solution.

325
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,439
We're losing time.

326
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,951
With these we need some
more of those. A lot of more.

327
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,759
You two!
Go into the fare side.

328
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,714
We're losing time, come on!

329
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,480
You have to surend the campment
but be on your guard!

330
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,479
You know what happened
to Douglas?

331
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,359
Move aside! No!

332
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,955
No wait! He's worring of
the evil spirit.

333
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,673
- Tell them to lower the weapons.
- We're taking no chances.

334
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,072
Watch him men!

335
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,792
What are you doing? Tie them up!

336
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,352
They have to be in the forest.
Otherwise they'll die on us.

337
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,919
This is madness!

338
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,595
After last night they know
we're their only protection.

339
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,030
They're not going to run away
not with that mob and dogs out.

340
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,589
Take them back to the mill.

341
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,993
And then you can present two
fresh little corpses! Do it!

342
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,676
Keep watching men.

343
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,033
Nothing means more to me
than our complete success.

344
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,198
Trust me, Alexander.

345
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:06,425
Stop!

346
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,769
Stay still.
She won't hurt you.

347
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,414
She was looking for the wound.
She took him for Douglas.

348
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,610
She thought she'd killed him.
She is feeling guilty!

349
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,378
- Sentimental nonsense!
- It's worse. It's perverse.

350
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,459
Look at her behaviour,
silent, morose...

351
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,614
No! I won't here any more!

352
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,493
You are a scientist
not a witch-doctor!

353
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,776
Why did you open
the cage last night?

354
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,820
You heard Toko gasping, suf-
fering from the same condition...

355
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,425
as you. He provoked your pity.
But he'd set a trap.

356
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,978
Like all the savages hunters
they know how to lure their prey.

357
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,249
Every day I see something
in them which makes me...

358
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,293
doubt. Makes me wonder
about our theory.

359
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,810
Are you questioning the
validity of our work?

360
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,816
These creatures have lived...

361
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,328
in the forest, unknown to
the outside of the world.

362
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,691
Yet I see signs of intelligence
and emotion...

363
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,497
similar to our own.

364
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,654
This could be our greatest
discovery.

365
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,692
We have to find out more.

366
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,652
So we have to postpone our
presentation to the Academy.

367
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,178
No, we're not wrong.

368
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,690
We have facts, figures, detailed
analysis, precise comparisons...

369
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,139
learned opinion and all
you have Jamie...

370
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,174
are vague feelings.

371
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,451
It's not enough.
I want proof.

372
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,529
One.

373
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,614
Two.

374
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,849
Three.

375
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,408
Don't let me down, Toko.

376
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,937
I know how intelligent you are
and we have to show the rest.

377
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,177
Show them that you're just
like me! Come on, Toko!

378
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,257
Sha'dop! Sha'dop!

379
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,059
I can't believe it.

380
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,137
- I should have never gone away.
- Calm yourself, my love.

381
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,374
Yes, it was a terrible and
shocking accident.

382
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,418
Poor Douglas!

383
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,812
I can't believe you could do...

384
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,410
I've taken good care
of the family.

385
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,412
- Generous pension.
- How can you talk about money?

386
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,732
About "taking care of".

387
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,418
Fraser's killed a man!

388
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,499
How can anyone live on a
happiness with that knowledge?

389
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,891
Give me your hand.

390
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,733
It's all right.

391
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,609
Your thumb...

392
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,689
You mean Dr Dodd a woman's
brain is about 4/5 of a man?

393
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,896
Generally speaking.

394
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,332
According to your tabulations,
my brain...

395
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,897
is about equal to the
average African male?

396
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,819
Possibly.

397
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,539
Consider
that poor sad females...

398
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,490
even the most exceptional
of women is not going...

399
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,693
to make more of an impression
on you than a simple Negro.

400
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:41,331
When you present the pygmies
it's going to be a huge success.

401
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,694
Scientists and anthropologists
from all Europe...

402
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,374
will want to come and see
them and study them.

403
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,418
People will fascinated.

404
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,778
The huge demand: Berlin,
Amsterdam, Paris...

405
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,811
They trust you, the pygmies.
You've tamed them.

406
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,254
I don't know.

407
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,809
Dr Dodd...

408
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,215
I'd be very happy if
you'd come with me and...

409
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,691
And, what?

410
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,336
I think we've made
an excellent alliance.

411
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,939
"Alliance"?

412
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,738
Except the pygmies won't be
making any "tour of Europe".

413
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,735
They'd die. They won't
last a week.

414
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,651
Anyway, I'm taking them back.

415
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,059
To Africa.

416
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,779
You're too late.

417
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,176
You can't stop the world
being curious.

418
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,009
I'll not let you make your
fortune frome exploiting them.

419
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,059
Just remember it was you who
took them from their forest.

420
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,095
This is your experiment,
not mine!

421
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,254
You're the one who's prodding
and poking and drugging them.

422
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,652
I do not need any lessons in
exploitation from you sir!

423
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,018
Stay here.

424
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,649
Let me see what our
little hunter's up to.

425
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,208
Fray-ser...

426
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,854
Likola.

427
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,893
Stay there.

428
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,939
Jamie... forgive me.

429
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,659
It's important.

430
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,773
Alexander wants to see you,
he discovered something.

431
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,570
Any luck with Likola's song?

432
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,373
I'm sorry. There was nothing
... as indeterminated birsong.

433
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,931
You really can't call it
music.

434
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,418
Jamie come and have a look.

435
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,619
I think they've been
drawing things on the wall.

436
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,453
Look!

437
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,168
You see!

438
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,731
I'm sorry,
I can't see a thing.

439
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,934
What are you doing?
Open the door!

440
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,899
No, I won't open because
I refuse to risk losing...

441
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,700
everything because
of your madness.

442
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,611
You've trained those pygmies
against me!

443
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,575
Your litlle savage
tried to kill me!

444
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,895
What are you talking about?

445
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,216
Where are they?
They need me by their side.

446
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,289
They are safe,
that's all you need to know.

447
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,617
Ready for their great day.

448
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,779
- Lf you've harmed them...
- Why are you against me?

449
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,411
Why do you try
to destroy everything?

450
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:59,613
This isn't about you and me.
We've taken the wrong road.

451
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,172
It's a criminal act to present
the pygmies as the missing link.

452
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,413
How dare you?
How?

453
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,132
Get your hands off my neck.

454
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,452
Where are they?

455
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,170
Get him off me!
Take you hands off me!

456
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,734
Open the door!
Where are they?

457
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,015
Keep him there.

458
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,017
Dr Dodd is very ill.

459
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,529
A contagion from
the savages.

460
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,733
Let no one in!

461
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,373
The history of humanity is
like a gigantic tree...

462
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,578
...of which we only see
the uppermost branches.

463
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,937
And this prompts us to ask
where do we come from?

464
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,568
Where are our roots
to be found?

465
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,535
Today, we can demarcate
three great races:

466
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,771
The white, or Caucasian.

467
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,777
The yellow, or Asiatic.

468
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,369
And the black, or Negroid.

469
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,898
Within these are
many sub-classes.

470
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,939
Caucasian Aryans,
American Indians...

471
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,177
Australian Aborigines and the
latest the Melanesian Negro.

472
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:36,695
I have the privilege to present
to you evidence of a new race.

473
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,057
More ancient
of any of the others.

474
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:55,092
And I have to say, the first
time we caught sight of these...

475
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,131
beings... I felt like Columbus
discovering America.

476
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,010
And the crucial question is:
Are the pygmies we present...

477
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,096
the missing link between
apes and mankind?

478
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,370
These are the most primitive
beings ever been discovered.

479
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,773
It has taken us many weeks
to study and analyse them.

480
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,252
Their mental faculties are
extremely simple.

481
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,776
Markedly aggresive.

482
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,256
They lack decency, and their
personal habits are repugnant.

483
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,892
This is the savage
almost animal.

484
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,974
Dr Dodd, eat!

485
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,939
You have to eat.

486
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,290
Five foot one inch, a weight
of six stone three pounds.

487
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,859
Notice a distinct prognathous
jaw, wool like hair...

488
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,937
and the auricular angles
far lower than human norms.

489
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,098
An acute curvature of
the spine indicating...

490
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,850
that the subject has spent
less time standing on two feet.

491
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,856
We see the same effect in
Orangutans.

492
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,692
And the size of the brain
compaired to other human species

493
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,410
would give
the stature of a genius!

494
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,454
The volume of the brain
is 47 cubic inches.

495
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,971
The skull itself, particularly
the protruberant nature...

496
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,939
of the parietal lobe, recalls
that of Neanderthal man...

497
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,929
Considering the extent of our
measurements and analysis...

498
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,177
their unique distinguishing
marks and the general savagery

499
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,450
of their behaviour, we believe
that we have te first branch...

500
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,333
that grew upon
the human tree.

501
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,659
Congratulations.

502
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,814
We have more discussion here.
You must visit our university.

503
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,335
Gentlemen,
your attention please.

504
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,494
I want to say that to put it
on record, that Dr Dodd...

505
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,373
one of our dearest friends has
chosen not to be with us today.

506
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,056
He does not entirely
share our conclusions.

507
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,054
Dr Dodd feels strongly that
behind the animality...

508
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,289
of these creatures, there is
intelligence and sensibility.

509
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,018
He believes he has witnessed
a genuine humanity in them.

510
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:14,858
He believes that the entire
classification and hierarchy...

511
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,451
of the races
must be reexamined!

512
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,459
Stay back!

513
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,698
Go on! Move.

514
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,492
Look at them!

515
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,611
The pygmies will enchant
Parisians.

516
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,690
I predict a phenomenal success.

517
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,739
I have a contracted agreement
with Madame Van den Ende.

518
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,490
I have the pygmies in my zoo
untill the end of the summer.

519
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,855
You are going to miss the
height of the season in Paris.

520
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,098
You must be patient dear Comte.

521
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,416
Would you allow me
to approach them?

522
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,854
I am simple professor always
fascinated by new discoveries.

523
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,455
Le Compte de Verchemont has
shown the greatest interest.

524
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,213
Isn't that right, Fraser?

525
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,380
What? Yes, indeed.

526
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,373
I've no objections. Would you
arrange a visit, Mr Beckinsale?

527
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,411
We have requests from all over
Europe to exhib them.

528
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,129
It seens everyone wants to get
a glimpse of primitive life.

529
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,130
Thanks to my brother
and my husband.

530
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,213
They're the people who
started all this craze...

531
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,415
You forget Dr Dodd. I hear
he hasn't been well.

532
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,088
Is someone able to give me
some encouraging news?

533
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,934
The illness afflicting Dr Dodd
has no remedy.

534
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,851
I don't think anyone can do
anything to help him.

535
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,859
Poor Jamie.

536
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,129
No need to worry Dr Dodd.
The fever is gone.

537
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,816
I think you can go home now.

538
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,493
Likola!

539
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,535
Toko!

540
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,251
Toko it's me Jamie.

541
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,459
It's Jamie!

542
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,059
Toko gone.

543
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,332
Toko dead.

544
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,692
Toko dead!

545
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,137
Why are they not eating? Why
are they so tired, so inactive?

546
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,928
They're no use to me like this.
What's happened?

547
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,779
It's a good question.

548
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,809
I find it astonishing that
you're able to study them.

549
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,169
I assure you they were amenable.
We had none of these problems.

550
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,410
Toko... do what I do.

551
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,298
Madame,
good day gentlemen.

552
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:04,176
Zackary? There'll be
no show today.

553
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,169
I'm most grateful to you,
Doctor. Best of luck.

554
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,892
They haven't eaten
for four days.

555
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,409
Well done, good.
I'm proud of you...

556
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,099
Eat.

557
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,292
Eat Toko.

558
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,858
Toko you must eat!

559
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,011
Likola... two.

560
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,208
Baby...

561
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,419
Bay-bee.
Sha'dop.

562
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,579
Bay-bee. Sha'dop.

563
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,092
The behaviour of the pygmies
has cast some doubt.

564
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:53,329
There is no even more urgency
to verify their findings or not.

565
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,617
I can't just turn anthropologists
just the way they are.

566
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,897
They've paid good money.

567
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,618
Get her to do it then.

568
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,258
She's hiring out these
"African circus artists".

569
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,013
Get her to say the contract
is invalid.

570
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,934
I forbid any visit which would
only weaken the pygmies further.

571
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,738
They need just one doctor.
I shall stay close to them.

572
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,330
Let's concede with great
reluctance...

573
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,051
that you are able to get them
fit and well again. Then what?

574
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,768
You're about to witness for
the first time in Europe...

575
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,979
the real nature of savage life
in the jungles of Africa.

576
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,975
Likola! Make fire!
Toko! Go hunting!

577
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,136
Likola, more fire!

578
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,256
Toko, more hunting!

579
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,292
What is he playing at?

580
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,098
Don't frighten them!

581
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,332
Does she know to use it?

582
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,695
Yes, my God, she does!
We must stop her!

583
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,497
Intolerable! Outrageous!

584
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,578
Sha'dop! Sha'dop!

585
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,973
Let's get out of here.

586
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,129
Very funny...

587
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,254
Thank you.

588
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,410
Some people say you're mad,
some say you're a genius.

589
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:49,459
Alexander says you've
"trained" them. Is it true?

590
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,772
- I didn't "train" them.
- And your pover over them?

591
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,215
It's not power either.
Mr Purvis you comprehend...

592
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,178
what I'm saying to you,
but I have no power over you.

593
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,808
It's the same with them.
We understand each other.

594
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,258
They're just like you and me.

595
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,939
Fray-ser.

596
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,773
She must be pregnant.

597
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,132
It's uncanny how the baboons
can sense a pregnancy.

598
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,537
- Are you absolutely sure?
- It's not cast-iron proof...

599
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,333
If we could have a foetus from
the female, it's perfect...

600
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,928
and this is ideal. We don't
need them anymore.

601
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,416
They are going to be dragged
across Europe on public display.

602
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,337
If we could abort this foetus,
we can establish far more...

603
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,732
about differences from an embryo
than from a living creature.

604
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,535
We're talking about her child!

605
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,575
We're talking about an embryo
from a scientific speciment.

606
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,933
We need to remove the doubt
that's creeping in.

607
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,611
This is what will
clinch it for us.

608
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,017
This is waht will
make our names...

609
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,772
Don't look!

610
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,579
You can turn around.

611
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,010
Talk of the town.

612
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,571
Dr Dodd! Are you quite well?
A smile on your face?

613
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,528
This party mustn't turn
into a grotesque funfair.

614
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,490
It won't. It's very good of
of Sir Walter to arrange this.

615
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,892
How much will you be make out
of it? Madame Van den Ende...

616
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:47,139
Same as you three. We agreed.
Half for me half for you.

617
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:54,377
Everyone would be there.
Important people, wealthy...

618
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,332
If you don't stand up for what
you believe in, who will?

619
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,371
We are allies now.

620
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,173
I hope you don't find the
association too painful.

621
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,457
The most important reason for vitation,
was the are genuinely your guests...

622
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,819
then that must mean
they are genuinely free.

623
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:31,172
And that freedom
is not merely symbolic.

624
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,409
I'm very happy to announce,
thanks to your kindness...

625
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,170
and the extraordinary
generosity of our host...

626
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,017
neither Toko or Likola will
be returning to the zoo.

627
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,931
They are trully free now.

628
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,090
- Free to return to their land.
- Or free to remain here.

629
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,135
We are happy to offer
our hospitality.

630
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,253
Thank you.

631
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,735
One thing I'd ask of you all.

632
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:16,736
Do not look at your guests
as strange and exotic beings.

633
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,488
Treat them as you would
your friends.

634
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,414
You'll be surprised
by the response.

635
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,933
Mister Walter,
may I introduce... Likola.

636
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,577
Welcome Likola.

637
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,209
- And Toko.
- Welcome Toko.

638
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,899
Welcome!

639
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,618
Tell her your name first.

640
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,212
- Andrew.
- Likola.

641
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,899
Hello, Toko.

642
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,692
Welcome to Edinburgh.

643
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,850
Very eloquent, Doctor Dodd.
They loved it.

644
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,817
You deserve it.

645
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,932
I know you suffered a lot but
I've to take the pygmies...

646
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,770
back to the zoo. They are
legally still in my employ.

647
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,934
Duck, fish, fruits, lot of
fruits. You must try them.

648
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,498
Your rooms are down here.

649
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,132
Are we sure we can trust your
savages not to murder us in bed?

650
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,574
Absolutely. I don't know
how to thank you, sir.

651
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,978
Don't thank me. It was
your colleague's idea.

652
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,016
- Madame van den Ende?
- No. Fraser MacBride.

653
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,054
Excuse me!
Toko!

654
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,253
Gently, gently.

655
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,453
Let no one in.

656
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,893
Come along there!
No time to waste!

657
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,495
How do you know that they
have taken her to Museum?

658
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,696
It's Alexander's base there.

659
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,693
It's safe and all
very scientific!

660
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,978
They must know she's pregnant.
That's why they thought up party.

661
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,372
To kidnap her.

662
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,049
I'd like to believe you had
nothing to do with this!

663
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:09,819
How dare you even suggesting
such a thing? I had no idea!

664
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,937
I'm on your side.

665
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,094
She's ready.

666
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,968
Would you just confirm the
actual state of the patient?

667
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,337
Fray-ser...

668
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,259
Sha'dop.

669
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,178
Well, is she?

670
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,017
I can't be sure.

671
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,456
For God's sake!
Professor!

672
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,779
- Open the gate now!
- They have not to be disturbed.

673
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,813
I demand to see
the professors.

674
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,698
Have you any ida who I am?

675
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,689
Well then open the door before
we waste any more time.

676
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,416
She's definitly pregnant.
We chloroform.

677
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,618
Get out of my way.

678
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,654
This is inhuman,
we can't do this.

679
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,618
We have to start.

680
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,653
Jesus Christ!

681
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,730
What in God's name
do you think you're doing?

682
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,813
Move!

683
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,379
You have no right to be
here. You're trespassing.

684
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,015
How dare you talk to us
about breaking the laws?

685
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,176
The law does not apply to
sub human, primitive beings.

686
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,693
The study of the embryo
is crucial!

687
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:28,376
Don't touch her! The child
she's carrying is maybe mine!

688
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,050
You must be stark!

689
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,014
You'll see when the child
is born.

690
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,372
No, get out! Get out!

691
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,576
- I won't forget this.
- I hope not.

692
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,096
By God, you'll pay for it.

693
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:07,814
You're not realy saying that you
fornicated with thiw Negress?

694
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,819
Yes I am.

695
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,092
I did.

696
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,018
Good God!

697
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,091
Why don't you buy me
a drink, darling?

698
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,215
What disease are you proposing
to give me tonight?

699
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,532
Anything you fancy, sweetheart.

700
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,370
Someone is in a hurry!

701
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,652
It's him! Get him!

702
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,134
There he is!

703
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,416
Careful. There is
no way out down there.

704
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,654
Toko! Please, he belongs to me.
I know what to do!

705
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,051
He must be on the boat!

706
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:09,614
Toko gone. Toko dead.

707
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,612
Are you going to tell them?

708
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,618
Tell them what?

709
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,049
That you are not
the father of the child.

710
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,456
I can't. It's the only thing
that protect us.

711
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,215
A pygmy child counts for nothing
but my child, that's different.

712
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,778
They'll accuse you of raping.

713
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,370
- You'll be stuck off.
- I don't care.

714
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,257
They'll shame you publicly.

715
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,009
- You'll be driven from country.
- I don't care.

716
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:31,175
Mister Toko Ambaki, born 26 of
October 1850...

717
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,369
in the province of Oubangui.
Profession: Circus artist.

718
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:41,376
Subject of the King Mateke Seko.
Is that correct?

719
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,215
According to the decision taken
by the magistrate court...

720
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:55,729
the body is to be placed at
the disposal of Royal Academy.

721
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,458
Would you sign here please?

722
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,657
Remove the body, please.

723
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,254
Are you all right?

724
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,295
Take her home.

725
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,613
I have to go to the Academy.
I'll catch up with you later.

726
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,612
Zachary, stay with her.

727
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,813
I know...

728
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,937
Madame, I beg you, you've
nothing to do with this man.

729
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,172
- He'll betray you as the others.
- Leave us alone, Mr MacBride.

730
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,653
I have to see Likola. I have
to protect her from this.

731
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,498
Get out of here!

732
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,053
This man is a monster!

733
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,689
The world should know
the evil's in this man!

734
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,610
He destroyed everything!

735
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,289
I've come here today to talk of
one thing and one thing only.

736
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,132
The killing of Douglas.

737
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,059
Everyone knows that the true
murderer is the female savage.

738
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,455
Here's the true
count of the affair.

739
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,050
The savage will receive the
death penalty...

740
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:41,056
and the embryo she's carrying
will be yielded up to science.

741
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,459
Unless what?

742
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,331
My brother insists that you
authernicate your results.

743
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,773
He wants to acknowledge your
manipulation of the pygmies.

744
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:12,650
And do disavow all your claims
for intelligence and humanity.

745
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:18,332
If you do this, the'll not
pursue the matter in courts.

746
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,379
Mister MacBride?

747
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,129
And do please tell Frayser that
our friend is as lively as ever.

748
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,054
Likola has become one of the
people I know best.

749
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:48,535
I know her sadness, her doubts,
her hopes and her dreams...

750
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,813
and this without one word
being exchanged between us.

751
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,094
Zachary was always fearful
on the journey...

752
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,055
worried what the tribesmen
would do if they knew...

753
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,657
we're travelling with a pygmy
so we travelled incognito.

754
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:32,573
Likola's renown slowly grew.
Who was this mysterious being?

755
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,253
Mr MacBride...

756
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,378
I'm going back to Africa.

757
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,379
It's where I should be...
It's where my heart is.

758
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,975
I may well see Dr Dodd,
Jamie...

759
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,732
Is there anything you
would like me to say to him?

760
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,578
Yes, Jamie...

761
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,651
Goodbye, Mr MacBride.

762
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,298
I'm very sorry.

763
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,938
Tell her to push Zachary!
Keep breathing.

764
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,413
Push... yes...

765
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,857
I can see your baby.
Push!

766
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,649
I wanted to go into the
forest with her...

767
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,096
to continue to protect her
and her baby boy...

768
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,689
but she made me understand that
our journey had come to an end.

769
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:26,574
There, at the border of her
land, the frontier of her world.

770
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,772
When Toko died...

771
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:19,099
I caught and held his last
breath in the palm of my hand.

772
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,416
This is a custom among certain
african tribes.

773
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,532
They believe whoever catches
the last breath...

774
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:34,210
who carry that dead person soul
and spirit with him forever...
