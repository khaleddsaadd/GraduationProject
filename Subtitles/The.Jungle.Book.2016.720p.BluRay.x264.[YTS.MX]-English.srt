1
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>Many strange tales
are told of this Jungle...</i>

2
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,653
<i>but none so strange...</i>

3
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,074
<i>as the tale of the cub we call Mowgli.</i>

4
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,898
You must be the very
worst wolf I've ever seen.

5
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,318
Yeah, but if that branch didn't break,
I would've made it.

6
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,321
Crossing upwind,
breaking from your numbers.

7
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,865
If you can't learn to run with the Pack...

8
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,491
one of these days,
you'll be someones dinner.

9
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,826
- How'd we do?
- Not Mowgli, again.

10
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,537
- He's never gonna make the Council.
- Let's go!

11
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,414
Race you to the top!

12
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,749
It was higher ground.

13
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,085
Wolves don't hide in trees.

14
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,420
I can't keep up with them, Bagheera.

15
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,589
I tried. I just picked the wrong tree.

16
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,090
It was a dead tree.

17
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,593
How was I supposed to know
it was dead?

18
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,886
It had a fig vine.

19
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,973
Any tree girdled by a creeper
is either dead or close to it.

20
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,143
- These are things a wolf must know.
- Yeah.

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,396
But if the branch didn't break,
I would've made it.

22
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,232
I realise you weren't born a wolf...

23
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,276
but couldn't you at least act like one?

24
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,907
<i>When I found him...</i>

25
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,658
<i>many years ago...</i>

26
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,621
<i>he was just an infant,
abandoned in the woods.</i>

27
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,289
Get the deer!

28
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,584
<i>If he was going to survive...</i>

29
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,295
<i>I knew he needed a people.</i>

30
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,255
<i>A people to protect him.</i>

31
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,218
<i>That's why I entrusted him
to the wolves.</i>

32
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,264
Look well, wolves.

33
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,019
<i>Akela was a just and noble leader.</i>

34
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,522
<i>He allowed Mowgli to dwell
among them, all those years.</i>

35
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,654
<i>The trouble was, wolves grew so fast...</i>

36
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,364
<i>and Mowgli...</i>

37
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,158
<i>let's just say he liked to take his time.</i>

38
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,493
Mowgli, pick me up high!

39
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,204
- My turn!
- Stop. Not now.

40
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,539
<i>It was Raksha who raised him.</i>

41
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,708
<i>She was the only mother he ever knew.</i>

42
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,753
- Come on, let's play!
- I don't feel like playing, Gray.

43
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,964
Come on, you're my brother.
You have to play with me.

44
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,007
Let's go chase some mice.

45
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,970
How did it go?

46
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,138
Caught me again.

47
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,808
If it's meant to be...

48
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,893
it will be.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,187
Let me hear the Law.

50
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,606
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

51
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,317
"as old and as true as the sky.

52
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,903
"The Wolf that keeps it will prosper...

53
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,823
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die.

54
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,534
"Like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk...

55
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,036
"the Law runneth over and back.

56
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,747
"For the strength of the Pack
is the Wolf...

57
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,376
"and the strength of the Wolf
is the Pack."

58
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,906
<i>Soon, the rain ceased to fall</i>

59
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,867
<i>and the dry season arrived.</i>

60
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,291
<i>Heat crept through the Jungle...</i>

61
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,834
<i>turning it yellow...</i>

62
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,252
<i>then brown...</i>

63
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,795
<i>then black.</i>

64
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,674
<i>But that year...</i>

65
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,844
<i>was the driest season
that anyone could remember.</i>

66
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,180
<i>Even the mohwa didn't flower.</i>

67
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,062
My leaf.

68
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,648
This is mine. Mine, mine, mine.

69
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,234
There's a rock. That's mud. That's mud.

70
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,861
There's a rock. That's my rock.

71
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,696
That's my rock.
Nobody touches my rock.

72
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,282
There's another rock.
Two rocks. Three rocks.

73
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,284
Peace Rock? Peace Rock!

74
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,913
It's the Truce! The Water Truce!

75
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,124
- It's the Water Truce!

76
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,086
<i>It had been many, many years</i>

77
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,171
<i>since the Peace Rock was revealed...</i>

78
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,174
<i>and the Water Truce was called.</i>

79
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,724
<i>Hunting at the riverbank</i>

80
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:31,809
<i>- was now forbidden...</i>

81
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,646
<i>because, by Law of the Jungle,
drinking comes before eating.</i>

82
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,899
<i>So, you could come to the Peace Rock,
on a day like this...</i>

83
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,152
<i>and find all people side-by-side.</i>

84
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,790
Don't forget.

85
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,916
No hunting.

86
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,000
Playing only.

87
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,585
Playing, only. I got it, <i>ami.</i>

88
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,087
And remember...

89
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,798
not everyone here has seen
a man-cub in the Jungle before.

90
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,341
So, behave yourself.

91
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,385
Okay, can I go now?

92
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,761
Take the pups with you.

93
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,888
Wait for me!

94
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,598
Come on, Gray!

95
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:13,976
Oh, take a look at this guy.

96
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:15,936
Excuse me.

97
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,771
Sorry.

98
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,065
- He's walking on two legs.
- Don't stare.

99
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,483
Hey, look. A wild boar.

100
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,027
And a rhino.
And a mongoose.

101
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,195
- Everybody's here.

102
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,656
Is that a peacock?

103
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,867
- Ooh, a stick!
- Oh, that's my stick.

104
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,493
- I like this stick.
- Seriously, that's my stick.

105
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,703
- This is my stick.
- No, that's my stick!

106
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,371
- Let go of my stick!
- It's a Water Truce!

107
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,707
- It's a Water Truce!

108
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:37,875
- Sorry.

109
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,461
My bad! It's involuntary.

110
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,588
I could pee on it.

111
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,298
Watch yourself, please.

112
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,091
Dad, what is that?

113
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,885
I think that's a man-cub.

114
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,053
What's a man-cub doing here?

115
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,223
- Whoa. Don't forget the Truce.

116
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,058
I know the Law, bucks.

117
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,443
What is that?

118
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,916
- Weird.
- That's weird.

119
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,460
Mowgli.

120
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,424
What was the rule about your tricks?

121
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,594
It's not the wolf way.

122
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,429
No more tricks.

123
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,266
Chin up, little one.

124
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,018
We'll make you a fine wolf, yet.

125
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,105
What about me?
Am I gonna be a fine wolf?

126
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,398
Look at me howl!

127
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,737
In some packs, the runt gets eaten.

128
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,113
Oh...

129
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,130
Mowgli, behind me.

130
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,553
Don't leave my side.

131
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:02,227
Everyone comes to Peace Rock.
So many smells to catch up on.

132
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,610
But, um...

133
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,531
I can't help but notice...

134
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,201
there's this strange odour today.

135
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,707
What is it, this scent that I'm on?

136
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,294
I almost...

137
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,547
I almost think it was some kind of...

138
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,424
man-cub.

139
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:38,096
Mowgli belongs
to my Pack, Shere Khan.

140
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,556
Mowgli?

141
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,309
They've given it a name.

142
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,898
When was it we came to adopt
man into the Jungle?

143
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,900
He's just a cub.

144
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:54,363
Does my face not remind you
of what a grown man can do?

145
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,409
Shift your hunting ground
for a few years...

146
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,454
and everyone forgets
how the Law works.

147
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,665
Well, let me remind you.

148
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,459
A man-cub becomes man...

149
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,420
and man is forbidden!

150
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,591
- What do you know about Law?
- Raksha.

151
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,219
Hunting for pleasure. Killing for power.

152
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,930
You've never known Law.
The cub is mine!

153
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,640
Mine to me.

154
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,892
So, go back to where you came from,
you burned beast!

155
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,774
The tiger knows who rules
this part of the Jungle.

156
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,777
I'm sure he doesn't mean to come here
and make threats.

157
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,489
Especially during a Water Truce.

158
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,960
No, I'm deeply respectful of these Laws
that keep us safe.

159
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,504
So, here's my promise.

160
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,173
Nothing lasts forever.

161
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,262
The rains will return
and the river will rise.

162
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,141
And when this rock disappears,
that Truce will end.

163
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,145
You want to protect him, fine.

164
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:14,192
But ask yourselves,
how many lives is a man-cub worth?

165
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,500
<i>How many lives?</i>

166
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,838
<i>Who could answer that question?</i>

167
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,203
- The rain!
- Rain!

168
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,370
- Rain!
- The rain!

169
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,416
Keep it dry, keep it dry, keep it dry.

170
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,336
These quills get stuck on everything!

171
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,882
<i>When the rains returned...</i>

172
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,385
<i>it was a question
the Council had to face.</i>

173
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,747
<i>They deliberated and they argued...</i>

174
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,582
<i>for many days.</i>

175
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,881
What do you think they're talking about?

176
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,761
<i>No one had ever come
between the Pack before.</i>

177
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,431
<i>But Shere Khan's threat...</i>

178
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,600
<i>was not to be ignored.</i>

179
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,403
Mowgli, you're not supposed
to go up there!

180
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,287
He's got to go.

181
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:32,998
Look at the skies.

182
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,293
Shere Khan may be heading here
as we speak.

183
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,046
Please!

184
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,549
I'm leaving.

185
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,345
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

186
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,514
Mowgli, go back to the den!

187
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,308
A man-cub belongs with man.

188
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,268
We raised him as one of our own!

189
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,104
- He'll have the boy, either way.
- Akela.

190
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,941
Maybe I can be of help.

191
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,484
The boy's right.

192
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,528
Maybe it's time he found another people.

193
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,364
- No.
- I'm the one who brought him to you.

194
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,658
And now I'll return him
to where he belongs.

195
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,118
I won't let you.

196
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,661
He's my cub!

197
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,163
We knew this day would come.

198
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,582
We are the only family he's ever known!

199
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,833
Raksha.

200
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,212
It's the only place he'll be safe.

201
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,135
It's okay, <i>ami.</i>

202
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,845
I won't go far.

203
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,681
I'll come back and visit.

204
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,435
Never forget this...

205
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,188
You're mine.

206
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,898
Mine to me.

207
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,152
No matter where you go,
or what they may call you...

208
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,737
you will always be...

209
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,447
my son.

210
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,861
<i>I wish I could tell you...</i>

211
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,572
<i>that the wolves
could've fought Shere Khan.</i>

212
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,576
<i>But this is not that kind of a tale.</i>

213
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,747
The turtles like me.

214
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,749
Maybe the crocodiles.

215
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,376
What about the rhinos?

216
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,420
They always let me hang around.

217
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,715
Of course, the rhinos sleep standing up.

218
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,260
I don't think I'd be very good at that.

219
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,721
It's either the turtles or the crocodiles.

220
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,597
Which one do you think is better?

221
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,016
Neither.

222
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,851
What do you mean?

223
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,228
I'm bringing you to the man village.

224
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,605
What?

225
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,567
Bagheera, I don't know man.

226
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:06,860
You will.

227
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,447
You always said we're not supposed

228
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,615
to go near a man village.

229
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,617
That was different.

230
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,369
Why is it different?

231
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,413
You always said, "Stay away
from the man village...

232
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,081
"because you might fall in a trap...

233
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,751
"or get eaten,
or get hurt by flying rocks."

234
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,586
I know what I said.

235
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,719
Whoa. Elephants.

236
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,305
- Bow your head.
- Why?

237
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,474
Show them respect.

238
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,435
The elephants created this Jungle.

239
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,645
Where they made furrows
with their tusks,

240
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,980
the rivers ran.

241
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,899
Where they blew with
their trunks, the leaves fell.

242
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,319
They made all that belongs.

243
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,487
The mountains, the trees...

244
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,781
the birds in the trees.

245
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,491
But they did not make you.

246
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,243
That is why you must go.

247
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,023
What if I live with the nilgai?

248
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,108
No.

249
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,818
Or the mongoose?

250
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,528
This is not a discussion.

251
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,987
But this is my home!

252
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,531
I don't even know what man's like.

253
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,949
You'll learn.

254
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,367
But I wanna stay in the Jungle.

255
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,077
Why do I have to go there?

256
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,412
Because the Jungle
is no longer safe for you.

257
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,580
You're being hunted...

258
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,040
by a tiger.

259
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,084
Only man can protect you now.

260
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,168
- Whoa!

261
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,214
This isn't fair.
You're not giving me a choice.

262
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,966
There's a lot of stuff
you're not telling me, too.

263
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,634
Don't think I didn't notice.

264
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,511
You say you're taking me
where I came from...

265
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,138
but you found me in the Jungle.

266
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,682
Are you bringing me back
to the Jungle? No.

267
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,225
Why are you bringing me
to the man village

268
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,643
if you found me in the Jungle?

269
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,728
And why does the tiger
hate me so much?

270
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,814
Does he know me?
Sure seems like he knows me.

271
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:08,940
Down.

272
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,819
What? Now we have to bow
to the buffalo, too?

273
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,863
Listen to me. This is not a game.

274
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,906
You're gonna run to that ravine.

275
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,908
What are you talking about?

276
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,827
Go to the north,
where the sky glows at night.

277
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:21,995
I'll find you on that path.

278
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,372
Bagheera, I'm not taking one
more step until you tell me...

279
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,109
Run, Mowgli!

280
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,945
Run!

281
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,249
Gray, what's wrong?

282
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,376
Why don't you come outside and play?

283
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,129
What is that?

284
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,093
Why did he have to leave?

285
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,261
Gray.

286
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:47,307
We could've protected him.
We shouldn't have let him go.

287
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,225
I miss him, too.

288
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,353
What's important is, he's safe now.

289
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,779
Get inside.

290
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,952
I suppose you know why I've come.

291
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,916
The man-cub has left the Jungle.

292
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,214
I thought I made myself clear.

293
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,549
I wanted him turned over to me.

294
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,469
We no longer harbour him.

295
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,305
He has left the Pack.

296
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:13,017
And where, may I ask, has he gone?

297
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,524
He's with his own kind now.

298
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,070
So, the man-cub has left the Jungle.

299
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,155
That's right.

300
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,908
You and I no longer have a quarrel.

301
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,993
And, most importantly...

302
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,495
we have peace.

303
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,087
I guess it's done, then.

304
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,382
Unless I can draw him...

305
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:45,883
back out!

306
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,844
Akela!

307
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,057
Have I got your attention now?

308
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,018
I didn't want it to be this way.

309
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,354
I made it so simple.

310
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:02,150
All I asked for was one thing,
and you denied me!

311
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,153
That ends now.

312
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,196
Spread the word.

313
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:11,117
Until I have the man-cub,
these hills are my hills.

314
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,703
You did not respond to reason!

315
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,913
So now, you will know fear.

316
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,376
Bagheera?

317
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,019
Hmm?

318
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,232
Hey, there.

319
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,362
Do you have a language?

320
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,368
You're kind of cute, I guess.

321
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,538
You want a bite?

322
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,458
Come on.

323
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,169
Come here. Come on, it's all right.

324
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,628
Don't be afraid.

325
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,681
Come on.

326
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,351
Hey, those are mine!

327
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,398
Hey, come back!

328
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,194
Those are mine!

329
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,489
Drop it!

330
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,381
Hello?

331
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,442
Who's out there?

332
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,736
Hi, little cub.

333
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,781
Oh, no. Don't be scared.

334
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,742
I'm not gonna hurt you.

335
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:32,915
I was just passing through.
I don't want any trouble.

336
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,084
There's no trouble.

337
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,962
Are you alone out here?

338
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,589
Mmm. That's not good.

339
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,425
We should never be alone.

340
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,428
I'm waiting for a friend.

341
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,430
He should be here soon.

342
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,976
I can stay with you,
until he gets here.

343
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,271
Would that be all right?

344
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,442
I'll keep you safe.

345
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,446
Just you and me, sweet thing.

346
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,076
Who are you?

347
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,039
Kaa.

348
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,256
Poor, sweet little cub.

349
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:26,218
What are you doing
so deep in the Jungle?

350
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,305
This is my home.

351
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,515
Don't you know what you are?

352
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,978
I know what you are.

353
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,858
I know where you came from.

354
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,444
You do?

355
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,487
Yes.

356
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,496
Would you like to see?

357
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,001
Yeah.

358
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,506
<i>Mostly, men stay in their village...</i>

359
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,217
<i>far from the dark of the Jungle.</i>

360
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,053
<i>But sometimes...</i>

361
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,721
<i>they travel.</i>

362
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,848
<i>And when they do...</i>

363
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:16,018
<i>their caves breathe in the dark.</i>

364
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,686
<i>They call it...</i>

365
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,523
<i>the Red Flower.</i>

366
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,409
<i>Man's creation.</i>

367
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,537
<i>It brings warmth and light...</i>

368
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,041
<i>and destruction to all that it touches.</i>

369
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,713
<i>Who is that?</i>

370
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,967
<i>The traveller, protecting his cub.</i>

371
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,826
<i>Shere Khan ended
the man's life that night.</i>

372
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:20,249
<i>But not before he was burned
by the Red Flower's touch.</i>

373
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:25,087
<i>He ran so fast, he didn't
notice the cub he left behind.</i>

374
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,141
<i>And that cub...</i>

375
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,434
<i>was you.</i>

376
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,127
<i>The panther found you.</i>

377
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,808
Oh, you poor, sweet thing.

378
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:24,271
You want to stay in the Jungle?

379
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:31,487
You can be with me, if you want.

380
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,656
I'll keep you close.

381
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,494
Let go of your fear, now.

382
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,540
Trust...

383
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,167
in me.

384
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,739
Relax, kid.

385
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,199
No need to get worked up. Okay?

386
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,326
- Where am I?
- Uh...

387
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:22,538
This is a cave. It's my cave.

388
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,166
You don't remember
what happened, do you?

389
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,544
- No.
- I saved your life.

390
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,588
Yeah, I snatched you
from the jaws of death.

391
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,924
The coils of death, if you will.

392
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,968
And lucky for you...

393
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,220
your new favourite hero,
old Baloo, here...

394
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,722
just happened to be passing by.

395
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:41,890
Uh, no big deal.

396
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,184
Just tell me this.

397
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,936
Can you...

398
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,564
climb?

399
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,483
Yeah.

400
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,736
Then let's quit wasting time
and get on with it.

401
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,405
Get on with what?

402
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,907
Payback, kid. Payback.

403
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:02,035
What do you mean "payback"?
Payback for what?

404
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,247
You owe me, kid.

405
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,124
You owe me. You owe me.

406
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,292
Slow down.

407
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,210
- And you're gonna pay back.
- But, but...

408
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,461
Because that's right.

409
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:12,796
You're gonna do the right thing.

410
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:13,964
That's the right thing to do.

411
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,465
You're gonna pay me back,
because you owe me.

412
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:16,717
You got it?

413
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,436
Okay, here's our little task.

414
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,605
You see that golden stuff,
dripping down there?

415
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,398
That's called "honey."

416
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,442
All you need to do, little one...

417
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,068
for payback purposes...

418
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,613
is to just shimmy on up there...

419
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,324
and get me that thing up there
that's making that funny noise...

420
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,992
- and bring it back down.

421
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,871
You're kidding me, right?

422
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,415
No, not really.

423
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,084
I can get killed going up there.

424
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,461
Kid!

425
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,088
Kid, kid, kid. Try to understand this.

426
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,757
I'm a bear.

427
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,468
It means that I have to eat my weight...

428
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:00,677
every day...

429
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,471
for hibernation purposes.

430
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,182
I know I'm asking for a lot...

431
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,392
but I don't climb and you do.

432
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:11,104
Look, I really need your help.
Winter's coming.

433
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,273
You don't want me to go to sleep...

434
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,275
and never wake up.

435
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,070
There are a lot of bees up here.

436
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,905
Yeah, some.

437
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,366
But don't worry. These ones don't sting.

438
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,125
Attaboy !

439
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,419
Ow! I'm getting stung!

440
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,715
Okay.

441
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:05,635
I would've done this myself,
but I'm afraid of heights.

442
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,262
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

443
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:08,764
Why don't you mind your own business?

444
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,098
You can do it!

445
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,225
- He's just gonna run away.
- Not this one.

446
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,144
As soon as the monkeys get stung,
they always run away.

447
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,396
- He's not a monkey. A man-cub.
- What is he?

448
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,690
A man-cub?
Yeah! Could you keep your voice down?

449
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,025
I'm trying to concentrate.

450
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,362
- Everything going A-okay up there?
- Ow!

451
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,906
Oh, boy. Looks like you got another one.

452
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,449
- Buzz off.
- It's a man-cub.

453
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:28,950
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

454
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,411
- It's not a monkey?
- No, it's a man-cub!

455
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,456
You have never been
a more endangered species...

456
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:36,124
than you are at this moment.

457
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,502
You're doing an amazing job!

458
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,128
I'm getting stung!

459
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:41,922
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

460
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,799
- It's not a monkey, Fred.
- It's a man-cub.

461
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,300
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

462
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,052
- Can you believe it?
- Are you sure?

463
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,762
Would you please shut up?

464
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,305
Hey, up there!

465
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,641
Everything is going fantastically, I see.

466
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:55,811
Ow!

467
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,897
You got it!
Believe in yourself!

468
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,279
- There you go!
- Ow!

469
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,948
Come on! Almost!

470
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:09,825
Yeah!

471
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,326
Yeah!

472
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:14,830
Oh, yeah!

473
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,665
Uh-oh.

474
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:21,795
Fred?

475
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,017
Oh, yeah, exfoliate me.

476
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,273
You said they didn't sting.

477
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,316
What do you call this?

478
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,444
How the heck did you do that?

479
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,696
Oh, those must have been females!

480
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,782
They look like males
from down here.

481
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:52,701
Females do sting.

482
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,744
Just put some honey on those.

483
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:57,205
- Honey? Really?
- Yeah.

484
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,458
You put it on, you lick it off.
You feel much better.

485
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,668
It's nature's ointment.

486
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,378
I put it everywhere.

487
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,175
Thanks.

488
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,551
Okay, so, we're even now!

489
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,178
Hold on a minute.

490
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,804
What's your name anyway?

491
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,806
We were never properly introduced.

492
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,892
- Mowgli.
- Mowgli?

493
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,520
Mowgli is a terrific name.

494
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,231
I bet you got that one
all to yourself, too.

495
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:24,900
Hey!

496
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,401
Mowgli, look...

497
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,070
I got a lot of gathering to do
these next couple of weeks...

498
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,656
on account of the hibernation.

499
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,617
I could really use your help.

500
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,076
You know, if you stuck around...

501
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,621
I can't. I have to go to the man village.

502
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,498
Uh...

503
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,124
For what reason, man village?

504
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,460
I don't have a choice.
There's a tiger hunting me.

505
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,253
Really? Why a tiger?

506
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,922
Because I'm a man-cub, all right?

507
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,423
Just leave me alone.

508
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,429
Hey! Mowgli, my friend,
my buddy, my pal.

509
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,139
Slow down a second, handsome.

510
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:58,475
Bagheera said I have to go
to the man village.

511
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:02,771
Oh, Bagheera! I know him. Sure.

512
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,523
You know what his problem is?

513
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,858
He always plays by the rules.

514
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,985
And, sometimes rules
were meant to be...

515
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,488
well, not necessarily broken,
but certainly bent.

516
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:14,032
And definitely reinterpreted.
Don't you think?

517
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,785
He told me to go to the man village,
so, that's where I'm gonna go!

518
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,911
Okay, fine.

519
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,621
You wanna go to the man village,
have it your way.

520
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,623
In fact, I'll do you one better.

521
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,667
I'll take you there myself.

522
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,669
Come on, let's go. It's getting late.

523
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,093
<i>Bare necessities</i>

524
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,177
<i>Forget about</i>

525
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:38,181
<i>Your worries and your strife</i>

526
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:41,851
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

527
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,353
What's that?

528
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,814
That's a song about the good life.

529
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,066
What's a song?

530
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,902
You never heard a song before?

531
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,946
Everyone's got a song.

532
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,739
Didn't the wolves ever sing?

533
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,116
I don't know.

534
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,617
Uh... Oh...

535
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:00,328
We recited the Law of the Jungle.

536
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,998
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

537
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,500
"as old and as true as the sky.

538
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,502
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

539
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,380
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die."

540
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:13,842
Kid, that's not a song.

541
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,927
That's propaganda.

542
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,765
What's propaganda?

543
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:28,732
Just a little farther.

544
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,783
That's the man village?

545
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,620
Yep. You can always
tell by the Red Flower.

546
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:44,039
They do love their Red Flower.

547
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:49,127
The Red Flower doesn't seem so bad.

548
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,295
Yeah.

549
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,340
Let it loose, and it destroys
everything it touches.

550
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:54,507
Don't ever play with it.

551
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:55,967
You got that?

552
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:57,218
Yeah, I got it.

553
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,386
Good.

554
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,603
Do you think that's where I'm from?

555
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,104
Could be.

556
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,106
I don't know, kid. Does it look familiar?

557
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,566
I don't remember it.

558
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:14,736
All I remember is living with the wolves.

559
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,530
Why do you wanna go there?

560
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,699
- Bagheera said I need a people.

561
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,661
Again, with the listening to Bagheera.

562
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,496
Hey, he's my friend, okay?

563
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,207
Now I don't even know where he is.

564
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,673
I can't believe I'm leaving
the Jungle for good.

565
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,257
May I say just one thing?

566
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,135
What I saw you do today,
I've never seen anything like it.

567
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,346
I've been trying to get
that honey for years.

568
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,973
But I used my tricks.

569
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,350
What tricks?

570
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,268
You know...

571
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,855
Everything that I built.
It's not the wolf way.

572
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,816
Who cares? "The wolf way."

573
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,484
That's the Mowgli way.

574
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:55,902
That's the Baloo way.

575
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:57,195
That's our way.

576
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:58,738
That's how we get things done.

577
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,824
I can't even imagine what kind
of potential you'd have...

578
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,159
if you had somebody like me
helping you out.

579
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:06,663
You say you want to go
to the man village.

580
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,666
I say, you could be a man right here.

581
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,001
I'll tell you what.

582
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,837
Now you know where the man village is.

583
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,339
You can always go down there,
whenever you want.

584
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,174
But I would personally appreciate it...

585
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,260
as a personal favour to me, personally...

586
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:23,138
if we just worked together,
just us, tricks and all.

587
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,474
I think it would be interesting to see...

588
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,810
just how much honey
we could accumulate...

589
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,353
before winter.

590
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,939
Whatever I could do to make
your trickiness happen...

591
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,190
I will do.

592
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,152
And if it turns out to
not be fun for you...

593
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,280
I will walk you right down
to that man village myself.

594
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,406
Is that a deal?

595
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,660
Just till winter.

596
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,080
Just till winter.

597
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,340
<i>Ami,</i> wake up.

598
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,514
Pups?

599
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,308
They're up there.

600
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:17,942
The deer, of course,
take comfort in numbers.

601
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:22,071
They lack defences
most animals will have.

602
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,532
And if we're being honest...

603
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,285
they're not very smart either.

604
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:28,912
- Unlike the mother crocodile,

605
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:30,205
who is a good deal more clever.

606
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:37,712
But the one you have to watch out for...

607
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,381
is the cuckoo bird.

608
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,219
Do you know
how the cuckoo bird survives?

609
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,555
By preying on a mother's weakness.

610
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:51,059
The cuckoo bird is too clever
to raise its young.

611
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:52,352
Instead, it sneaks...

612
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,480
its eggs into the nests of simpler birds.

613
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,148
So, when they hatch...

614
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,317
the mother bird is fooled.

615
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,820
She feeds them, nurtures them.

616
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:05,907
And do you know what happens
to her own chicks?

617
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,284
They starve...

618
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,661
and die...

619
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,287
from neglect.

620
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,958
All because a mother loved a chick...

621
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:18,837
that wasn't her own.

622
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,840
Come now, time for sleep.

623
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:40,984
I think they like me.

624
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,529
Why are you doing this?

625
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,489
He's gone.

626
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,449
Isn't that what you wanted?

627
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,494
I want him dead.

628
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,668
Once he gets word
of what happened here...

629
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,211
he'll come back.

630
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,131
And I'll be waiting.

631
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,188
- That's the first mark.
- Got it.

632
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:03,024
- That's the first mark!
- Got it!

633
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,362
That's the first mark!

634
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,529
Got it!

635
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,368
Whoo!

636
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:14,744
Yeah, I got it!

637
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:18,289
- Tell him to go to the second mark!
- Got it!

638
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:22,251
- Go to the second mark!
- Got it.

639
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,045
Got it.

640
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:27,882
<i>Look for the</i>

641
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,634
<i>Bare necessities</i>

642
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,886
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

643
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,471
<i>Forget about your worries</i>

644
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,390
<i>And your strife</i>

645
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,559
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

646
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,770
<i>Old Mother Nature's recipes</i>

647
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,731
<i>That bring the bare
necessities of life</i>

648
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,153
<i>Wherever I wander
Wherever I roam</i>

649
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,656
<i>I couldn't be fonder</i>

650
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,908
<i>Of my big home</i>

651
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,326
<i>The bees are buzzing</i>

652
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:56,744
<i>In the tree</i>

653
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,205
<i>To make some honey just for me</i>

654
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,499
<i>When you look under
the rocks and plants</i>

655
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,668
<i>And take a glance at them fancy ants</i>

656
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,586
<i>And then maybe try a few</i>

657
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,007
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

658
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,675
<i>They'll come to you!</i>

659
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:13,344
<i>- Wherever I wander</i>

660
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,264
<i>Wherever I roam</i>

661
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:17,932
<i>I couldn't be fonder</i>

662
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,101
<i>Of my big home</i>

663
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:22,520
<i>The bees are buzzing in the tree</i>

664
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,106
<i>To make some honey just for me</i>

665
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,859
<i>When you look

666
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,402
<i>And then take a glance

00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,779
<i>And then maybe try a few</i>

668
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,656
<i>Mmm! Mmm!</i>

669
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,492
<i>The bare necessities of life
They'll come to you</i>

670
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:39,370
<i>They will come to you</i>

671
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,789
<i>Yeah, they'll come to you!</i>

672
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,291
<i>Come to you!</i>

673
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,543
Baloo, Baloo, Baloo... look.

674
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,299
Stay low on my back.

675
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,808
Come on out and show yourself.

676
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,485
Bagheera! Ah!

677
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:12,070
Mowgli.

678
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:15,323
Oh, I was looking everywhere for you!

679
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,657
I thought you were gone!

680
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,326
- Are you all right?
- Yeah!

681
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,912
I can't believe you found me!
I was so worried about you.

682
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,664
I was lost, and I didn't know
what happened...

683
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,083
but then I met Baloo.

684
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,168
And then he saved me
from a giant snake!

685
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,920
And now we're working together!

686
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,005
Really?
That's a new wrinkle.

687
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:32,632
I didn't know sloth bears worked.

688
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,177
Come on, Mowgli, let's be on our way.

689
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:38,221
Wait!

690
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,432
Yeah, go on ahead. I'll catch up.

691
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,352
Don't be mad, okay?

692
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,603
Why would I be mad?

693
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,188
Because you're always mad
when I do stuff.

694
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:49,440
You gotta promise
not to be mad this time.

695
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,193
Show me, then I'll decide.

696
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,028
Come on, check it out!

697
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,033
These are vines I use on the cliff.

698
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,953
I twirl them together to make
them longer and stronger.

699
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,913
See how strong they are?

700
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,416
You wanna see the really cool part?

701
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,335
It's inside. Come on, let's go!

702
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:11,963
Come on!

703
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:25,601
It's the honey stash for winter!

704
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,147
Have you lost your mind?

705
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:32,150
You said you wouldn't get mad.

706
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,569
Did you listen to anything
Akela taught you?

707
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,778
There's no place...

708
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,738
in the Jungle for these...

709
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,906
tricks!

710
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,159
You want to do this,
you do this in the man village.

711
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:44,078
But I'm helping Baloo
get ready for hibernation.

712
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,455
Bears don't hibernate in a jungle.

713
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:47,915
What are you teaching him?

714
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,669
Not full hibernation, but I nap a lot.

715
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:54,130
Listen to me, you con artist!

716
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:56,257
He may not know your game, but I do.

717
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:58,384
- He's leaving now.
- But I don't wanna leave!

718
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,428
You don't have a choice!

719
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,180
Why don't we all just
settle down for a minute.

720
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,099
Look, it's gotten late.
Too late to travel.

721
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,018
So, why don't we all
just have a little honey...

722
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,603
I don't eat honey.

723
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,938
No problem. I'll eat the honey.

724
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,773
Let's all get a good night's sleep...

725
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,442
and we can talk about this
in the morning.

726
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:18,279
Fine. But we're leaving, first thing.

727
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,084
Mowgli.

728
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,011
Where is he?

729
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,263
- In the pit.
- In the what?

730
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:51,766
- Is this your teaching?
- Oh, come on!

731
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,769
You know I'd never teach him
to mess around with elephants.

732
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,740
Hey, guys.

733
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,711
What'd I tell you? He's special.

734
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:04,880
I know he's special.

735
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,507
I raised him.

736
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,553
Then don't make him leave, Bagheera!

737
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:13,013
You gotta let him be what he is.

738
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,724
You don't understand.
The boy's in danger.

739
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:18,394
I know, he told me.
He's being hunted by a tiger.

740
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:20,855
Not any tiger. Shere Khan.

741
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,357
Shere Khan's hunting him?

742
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:24,525
Oh.

743
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,694
But if you send him back
to the man village,

744
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:27,903
they'll ruin him.

745
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,780
They'll make a man out of him.

746
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,532
We should send him back
to the Wolf Pack.

747
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,243
Who's their alpha?
Akela, he can protect him.

748
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,245
Akela is dead.

749
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,206
- What?
- Shere Khan killed him.

750
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:42,543
He will stop at nothing
until he has this boy.

751
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,752
Nothing.

752
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,629
The only way we can save him...

753
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,965
is if he goes to that man village.

754
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,550
Please, Baloo.

755
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,136
You're the only one he'll listen to.

756
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,790
Hey, kid.

757
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,250
Hey.

758
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,878
That was pretty cool,
what you did back there.

759
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,881
Bagheera didn't think so.

760
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:31,634
Oh, no, I talked to him.
He was very impressed.

761
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:33,886
He was?

762
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:35,387
We both were. Yeah.

763
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:37,806
I've never seen anyone get

764
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:39,934
that close to an elephant before.

765
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,941
So, listen, kid.

766
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,235
I gotta talk to you about something.

767
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:50,903
What do you wanna talk about?

768
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,655
I've been thinking.

769
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,823
Now that your friend has shown up...

770
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,450
maybe it's time...

771
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:59,328
for you two to just mosey along.

772
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,999
Now it's winter...

773
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,834
and it's really time for you to go.

774
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,796
But I wanna stay here with you.

775
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,925
We're buddies, aren't we?

776
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,136
Huh? No, we were never friends.

777
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,472
I certainly never thought
of you as my friend.

778
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,809
You helped me get honey
and I don't really need you any more...

779
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,981
Do I have to spell this out?

780
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,403
I don't want you around any more.

781
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:46,709
I did it.

782
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:50,379
And that's about the hardest thing
I've ever done.

783
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,799
I know.

784
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:39,762
Go away.

785
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:47,561
Get away from me.

786
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,442
Stop it.

787
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:02,660
Get away from me!

788
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,081
Bagheera!

789
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,541
- Mowgli!

790
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,390
Mowgli, hold on!

791
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,020
Bagheera!

792
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,108
What was that?
Where are they taking him?

793
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:35,776
This way.

794
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:40,781
Ahh! Ah!

795
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,116
Whoa!

796
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,789
We see you! We see you!

797
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,259
Come on, jump!

798
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:01,719
And watch the claws.

799
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,503
Gah!

800
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:08,827
Uh...

801
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,746
I'll take it from here.

802
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:13,457
No, I'm coming.

803
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,334
It's doable...

804
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:17,711
if I don't have to go too high.

805
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,463
Good. Let's get going.

806
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:21,590
All right.

807
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,680
A bird. That can't be a good sign.

808
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:13,433
Baloo.
Look at me. Look at nothing but me.

809
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,644
- Hmm?
- You're doing fine.

810
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,104
Just keep your eyes up high.

811
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:20,524
All right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

812
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,868
What part of the Jungle you from?

813
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,039
You, man-cub.

814
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,708
You come from the South, the North?

815
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,212
What part of the Jungle?

816
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:08,173
The South, I guess.

817
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:11,468
Southern Jungle, the Seeonee.

818
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:14,221
Beautiful, I hear.
I never been there myself.

819
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:20,727
So, tell me, you ever had
a taste of the pawpaw fruit...

820
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,354
down there in the Seeonee?

821
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,815
Some people call it the...
What's the word?

822
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,484
Papaya. Stolen words.

823
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:29,277
I say pawpaw.

824
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:32,364
Goes to the sound it makes
when it tumbles to the Jungle floor.

825
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:35,158
Try it.

826
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:42,040
Go ahead.

827
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,466
It's good.

828
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,178
You know who I am?

829
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:57,389
No.

830
01:06:57,973 --> 01:07:01,018
I am the King of the Bandar-log.

831
01:07:04,396 --> 01:07:05,605
Call me Louie.

832
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:16,950
I did it!

833
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:19,536
- Well done, old chap.

834
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:24,875
He must be in there.
Follow me.

835
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,670
No, no.
We're on level ground here.

836
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,505
I'm in charge.

837
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:32,299
And I've got a plan.

838
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,887
You are a man-cub
who wants to live in the Jungle.

839
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:39,014
How do you know that?

840
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:40,474
Kid...

841
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,227
I got ears. My ears got ears.

842
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,063
You wanna live here?

843
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,648
You need a people to protect you.

844
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,817
Only I can protect you...

845
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,652
and I will, for a price.

846
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,322
I don't have anything to give you.

847
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,201
I think you do.

848
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:02,037
What?

849
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:04,456
Look around, man-cub.

850
01:08:04,623 --> 01:08:06,124
I got everything.

851
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,043
I have plentiful food...

852
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,419
endless treasure...

853
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,838
command vast legions.

854
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,758
But there's one thing I don't have...

855
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:16,510
and that's the one thing...

856
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,053
you can give me.

857
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,556
The Red Flower.

858
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,684
- I don't have that!

859
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,020
You're a man, aren't you?

860
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:30,482
That's what makes you a man.

861
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:32,984
You can summon the Red Flower...

862
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,945
and control it.

863
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,656
They told me not to go near
the Red Flower.

864
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:39,866
You know why they tell you that?

865
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:43,537
Because once you have it,
you rise to the top of the food chain.

866
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,540
Nothing in this Jungle can stand up...

867
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,251
to the Red Flower.

868
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,881
Please, I just wanna go.

869
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,804
<i>Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub</i>

870
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,973
<i>I'll make a deal with you</i>

871
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:06,059
<i>What I desire is man's red fire</i>

872
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:07,853
<i>To make my dream come true</i>

873
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:09,855
<i>Now give me the secret, man-cub</i>

874
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,691
<i>Come on!
Clue me what to do</i>

875
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,901
<i>Give me the power
of man's Red Flower</i>

876
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,903
<i>So I can be like you</i>

877
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,780
<i>Oh, ooo-be do</i>

878
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,616
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

879
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:25,871
<i>I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo</i>

880
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:31,001
<i>You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee</i>

881
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,964
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo</i>

882
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,134
<i>Now you might think
it's ridiculous that me</i>

883
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:42,053
<i>A Gigantopithecus,
would ever dream</i>

884
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,265
<i>I'd like to team with
the likes of you, man-cub</i>

885
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,475
<i>But together we'd have powers</i>

886
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:50,228
<i>All the Jungle's treasures, ours</i>

887
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,772
<i>I got desire, you got the fire</i>

888
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,441
<i>But the dream I dream takes two</i>

889
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,610
<i>So, oo-oo-oo</i>

890
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,904
<i>- I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

891
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:00,947
<i>I wanna use that flame</i>

892
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:03,617
<i>Just the same as you can do</i>

893
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:06,369
<i>Oh, how magnificus it would be</i>

894
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,121
<i>A Gigantopithecus like me</i>

895
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,415
<i>Could learn to do</i>

896
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,792
<i>Like you humans do-oo-oo</i>

897
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:16,421
Just one thing we need...

898
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,715
to reach our full potential.

899
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,092
Bring me that Red Flower...

900
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,053
and we will rule this Jungle.

901
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,679
I will protect you.

902
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:27,807
And you will want for nothing,
ever again.

903
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:29,935
- I can't!

904
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,020
You can't or you won't?

905
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,939
I can't!

906
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,315
You will!

907
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:36,983
Excuse me!

908
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,151
Anybody?

909
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:41,947
Excuse me...

910
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,199
am I in the right monkey temple?

911
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,201
Oh, my gosh.

912
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:49,371
Is that King Louie?

913
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,873
This is so exciting.

914
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:54,876
The legends do you no justice, sir.

915
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:58,672
You are truly enormous.

916
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:01,800
In the best way.

917
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:04,761
Look at all of that flesh...

918
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:06,763
just squatting there...

919
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,390
on an ancient throne.

920
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:09,683
How majestic.

921
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,810
Seize him.

922
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,396
Hey, hang on.

923
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,147
Can you just hang on?

924
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,192
I climbed a mountain to see you,
and I'm not a climber.

925
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:21,361
Just to be in your presence.

926
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:24,281
For me, this is a dream come true. Oh...

927
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,533
Throw him off the cliff.

928
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,120
Wait, wait, wait.

929
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:31,705
I have no problem with that.

930
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,373
I don't have any problem with that.

931
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,084
I came up here without an invitation.

932
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:38,044
It was extremely presumptuous of me.

933
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:39,504
Let me interrupt myself.

934
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,588
- I just gotta say...

935
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:43,550
you guys are so much handsomer
in person than anyone knows.

936
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:45,802
No one ever gets up close to you.

937
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:46,970
Why?

938
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:48,513
Because of the smell.

939
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,473
The smell is rough.

940
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,184
But it's not just, "Oh, look at me."

941
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:56,271
It's, "I got the brains."
You guys got the know-how.

942
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,398
You got the noggin.

943
01:11:58,815 --> 01:11:59,983
You came up with this stuff,
with the thumb.

944
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,736
Come on, show me.
How do you do that? I can't do that.

945
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:06,031
Look, I scratch, I rub, I can grab a fish.

946
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,867
But I was hoping, and you may
not be open to this at all...

947
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:11,244
but I was hoping,
and once again, it's a dream...

948
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:14,122
but I was hoping that I might become...

949
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:16,166
a Bandar-log myself.

950
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,251
Gosh, I wanna be like you.

951
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:20,420
I am hitching my wagon to your star.

952
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:26,718
No one leaves!

953
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,262
I can show myself out. Thanks. Bye-bye!

954
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,948
We'll try to hold them off.

955
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,985
Where you going, man-cub?

956
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,987
Stay away from me!

957
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:30,532
You don't have anyone now.

958
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:33,910
I'm your only hope.
I can make it real good for you here.

959
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,495
Where else you gonna go?

960
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:37,330
I'll go back to the Pack!

961
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,165
I'll go back to Akela!

962
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,042
Akela?

963
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:42,585
Oh.

964
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:43,962
You didn't hear?

965
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:47,841
Shere Khan killed him.

966
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,345
Must've been on account of you.

967
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,597
No! You're lying!

968
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:01,813
Don't run away...

969
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:07,026
from who you are!
You hear me?

970
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:36,055
Think about it, man-cub.

971
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:41,853
We can rule this Jungle.

972
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:45,690
No...

973
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,025
Listen to reason.

974
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:04,626
- Gotcha!

975
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,044
Mowgli!

976
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:14,612
If anything happens to that kid...

977
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,531
I'll never forgive myself.

978
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,450
- Bagheera!
- Mowgli?

979
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:21,744
Stay there.

980
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,913
We'll come around to you.

981
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:27,208
Is it true?

982
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:28,751
What?

983
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:31,337
Is Akela dead?

984
01:16:32,547 --> 01:16:34,007
We were going to tell you.

985
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,467
You knew!

986
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,177
You both knew!

987
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:40,888
And nobody did anything about it!

988
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,348
Kid, just hold on.

989
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:45,184
Someone's gotta do something!

990
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,312
- Mowgli!

991
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:06,868
There's no trace of him.

992
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:08,578
Where could he have gone?

993
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:24,635
Come on!

994
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:47,867
It's man.

995
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:49,368
He's come to the Jungle.

996
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:56,918
<i>Ami,</i> what's happening?

997
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,086
The Red Flower.

998
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,380
Everybody, get to the river!

999
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:16,437
Red Flower.

1000
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:17,563
Red Flower.

1001
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,566
Pups, come on. Stay close.

1002
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,124
Is that Mowgli?

1003
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:41,796
Shere Khan!

1004
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,715
Shere Khan!

1005
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,259
I'm not afraid of you!

1006
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,678
No one has to be afraid of you any more!

1007
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,308
No...

1008
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:01,190
I think they're afraid
of something else now.

1009
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,292
The man-cub is now a man.

1010
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:23,504
Gray...

1011
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,218
Always a proud day...

1012
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:31,804
when they come of age.

1013
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:38,644
You can fool them, but you can't fool me.

1014
01:21:39,437 --> 01:21:42,315
I'm the one who saw your future.

1015
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:45,526
I saw what you'd become.

1016
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:53,784
Come now, use the Red Flower.

1017
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,495
Use it on me like your father did.

1018
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,210
Show everyone what you really are!

1019
01:22:08,883 --> 01:22:12,345
I'm Mowgli of the Seeonee
and this is my home!

1020
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,687
That was the stupidest thing
you could've done.

1021
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:24,148
Now you have nothing.

1022
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,694
No claws, no fur, no teeth...

1023
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,739
And no friends.

1024
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:35,534
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

1025
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,037
"as old and as true as the sky."

1026
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:39,246
What is this?

1027
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:41,540
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

1028
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,918
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die."

1029
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:45,294
You fools.

1030
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:48,381
"Like the creeper that
girdles the tree trunk...

1031
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:50,091
"the Law runneth over and back."

1032
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,051
Fine! Rise up, all of you!

1033
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:54,845
You want to put yourselves
between me and the man-cub?

1034
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:58,015
"...and the strength
of the Wolf is the Pack."

1035
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,059
I will have you all in my teeth!

1036
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:27,044
- No!
- Wolves, attack!

1037
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:33,259
- Stay here!

1038
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,177
But I wanna fight with the wolves!

1039
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,888
- You can't fight him like a wolf.
- You're not a wolf!

1040
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:40,850
Fight him like a man.

1041
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:43,936
Now, go!

1042
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:46,897
Okay.

1043
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:47,982
We'll hold him off.

1044
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:38,407
It's time we put an end to this.

1045
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:39,575
No!

1046
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,176
Dead tree.

1047
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:06,871
It's just you and me now!

1048
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,221
Break, break!

1049
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,940
You've got nowhere to go, man-cub!

1050
01:28:37,313 --> 01:28:40,524
- Did you think I would let you grow old?

1051
01:28:49,283 --> 01:28:51,869
Either I'll devour you
or the Red Flower will.

1052
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,998
It's just a matter of time.

1053
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:03,172
How long did you really think
you'd survive against me?

1054
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:07,051
Longer than your father did?

1055
01:29:09,053 --> 01:29:12,181
Longer than... Akela?

1056
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:30,616
I'm not afraid of you!

1057
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,625
- Do you hear me?

1058
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:43,337
I'm done running from you!

1059
01:31:14,428 --> 01:31:16,430
You stood your ground, old boy.

1060
01:31:16,597 --> 01:31:18,265
You stood your ground.

1061
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:34,823
<i>Ami, ami!</i>

1062
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:38,994
My son.

1063
01:31:39,453 --> 01:31:41,163
- Mowgli!
- It's Mowgli!

1064
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:48,086
Mowgli.

1065
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:18,450
Will you look at that?

1066
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,922
<i>And where they made furrows
in the ground with their tusks...</i>

1067
01:32:32,089 --> 01:32:34,508
<i>there the rivers ran.</i>

1068
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:05,330
<i>In my years, I've seen
a lot in this Jungle.</i>

1069
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:07,583
<i>But that night...</i>

1070
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:10,377
<i>I saw something I'll never forget.</i>

1071
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:12,713
<i>I saw a little boy...</i>

1072
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,257
<i>without a people...</i>

1073
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:20,137
<i>bring all the Jungle together
for the very first time.</i>

1074
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:42,326
Just a few more turns.

1075
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:44,119
I'm going high!

1076
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:45,370
Stay low.

1077
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:51,585
He never listens.

1078
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:02,262
Gotcha!

1079
01:34:02,596 --> 01:34:03,513
- Come on, Mowgli.
- You went in the tree.

1080
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:04,598
- That wasn't fair.
- We almost made it.

1081
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:05,974
You guys...

1082
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:09,436
are going too fast.

1083
01:34:09,603 --> 01:34:11,980
Anybody ever teach you how to jog?

1084
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:15,108
You went high when everyone else
stayed on the trail.

1085
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,778
- But that's what you do.
- Maybe, but I'm not a wolf.

1086
01:34:17,944 --> 01:34:19,905
Next time, stay together.
Come on, guys.

1087
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:23,742
"For the strength of the Pack is the..."

1088
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:26,536
- Wolf.
- "Wolf...

1089
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:29,706
"and the strength of the Wolf
is the Pack."

1090
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,291
Mowgli's back!

1091
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,214
Hey, Mowgli! Wait for us.

1092
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:39,174
Hurry up, guys.

1093
01:34:39,383 --> 01:34:40,425
- Hi, Gray.

1094
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,140
Look well, wolves.

1095
01:34:53,772 --> 01:34:56,233
"This is the Law of the Jungle...

1096
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,361
"as old and as true as the sky.

1097
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:02,197
"The Wolf that keeps it may prosper...

1098
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:05,283
"but the Wolf that breaks it will die.

1099
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:08,286
"Like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk...

1100
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:10,706
"the Law runneth over and back.

1101
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,708
- "For the strength of the Pack..."

1102
01:35:15,961 --> 01:35:17,212
This is nice up here.

1103
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:20,257
Now he can climb.

1104
01:35:23,176 --> 01:35:26,388
Please don't tell me
you're about to head down.

1105
01:35:35,105 --> 01:35:37,107
I could get used to this.

1106
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:38,627
<i>Now I'm the king of the swingers</i>

1107
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,879
<i>Oh, the jungle VIP</i>

1108
01:36:41,171 --> 01:36:43,715
<i>I've reached the top and had to stop</i>

1109
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:45,717
<i>And that's what's botherin' me</i>

1110
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:47,969
<i>I wanna be a man, man-cub</i>

1111
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,180
<i>And stroll right into town</i>

1112
01:36:50,514 --> 01:36:52,724
<i>And be just like the other men</i>

1113
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,643
<i>I'm tired of monkeyin' around</i>

1114
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,478
<i>Oh, ooo-be do</i>

1115
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:59,314
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

1116
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:03,401
<i>I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo</i>

1117
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:08,490
<i>You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee</i>

1118
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:13,245
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo</i>

1119
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,914
<i>Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub</i>

1120
01:37:15,997 --> 01:37:17,582
<i>I'll make a deal with you</i>

1121
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:20,418
<i>What I desire is man's red fire</i>

1122
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:22,420
<i>To make my dream come true</i>

1123
01:37:22,546 --> 01:37:24,673
<i>Now give me the secret, man-cub</i>

1124
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,758
<i>Come on!
Clue me what to do</i>

1125
01:37:26,925 --> 01:37:29,594
<i>Give me the power
of man's Red Flower</i>

1126
01:37:29,678 --> 01:37:31,263
<i>So I can be like you</i>

1127
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,098
<i>Oh, ooo-be do</i>

1128
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:36,101
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

1129
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:40,272
<i>I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo</i>

1130
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:45,110
<i>You'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee</i>

1131
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:49,573
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo</i>

1132
01:38:26,902 --> 01:38:29,988
<i>Now you might think
it's ridiculous that me</i>

1133
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:32,824
<i>A Gigantopithecus,
would ever dream</i>

1134
01:38:32,908 --> 01:38:35,911
<i>I'd like to team with
the likes of you, man-cub</i>

1135
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:38,246
<i>But together we'd have powers</i>

1136
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:40,624
<i>All the Jungle's treasures, ours</i>

1137
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:41,833
<i>I got desire</i>

1138
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:42,918
<i>You got the fire</i>

1139
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:44,794
<i>But the dream I dream takes two</i>

1140
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:46,671
<i>- So, oo-oo-oo</i>

1141
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:49,382
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

1142
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,134
<i>I wanna use that flame</i>

1143
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:53,720
<i>Just the same as you can do</i>

1144
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,181
<i>Oh, how magnificus it would be</i>

1145
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:58,558
<i>A Gigantopithecus like me</i>

1146
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,185
<i>Could learn to do</i>

1147
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:03,313
<i>Like you humans do-oo-oo</i>

1148
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:07,692
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo</i>

1149
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:12,697
<i>Can learn to be
like someone like me-ee-ee</i>

1150
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:27,170
<i>Trust in me</i>

1151
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:31,383
<i>Just in me</i>

1152
01:39:32,092 --> 01:39:36,262
<i>Shut your eyes</i>

1153
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:41,101
<i>Trust in me</i>

1154
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:45,230
<i>You can sleep</i>

1155
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:50,360
<i>Safe and sound</i>

1156
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:57,450
<i>Knowing I am around</i>

1157
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:04,708
<i>Slip into silent slumber</i>

1158
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:09,754
<i>Sail on a silver mist</i>

1159
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:12,966
<i>Slowly and surely your senses</i>

1160
01:40:13,091 --> 01:40:17,929
<i>Will cease to resist</i>

1161
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:22,392
<i>Just relax</i>

1162
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:27,272
<i>Be at rest</i>

1163
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:31,443
<i>Like a bird</i>

1164
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:35,780
<i>In a nest</i>

1165
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:40,910
<i>Trust in me</i>

1166
01:40:41,077 --> 01:40:45,123
<i>Just in me</i>

1167
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:49,753
<i>Shut your eyes</i>

1168
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:53,965
<i>And trust in me</i>

1169
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:16,613
<i>Trust in me</i>

1170
01:41:17,155 --> 01:41:21,159
<i>Just in me</i>

1171
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:26,164
<i>Shut your eyes</i>

1172
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:31,211
<i>And trust in me</i>

1173
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,988
<i>Yeah</i>

1174
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:07,705
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

1175
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:11,042
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

1176
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:14,087
<i>Forget about your worries</i>

1177
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:15,672
<i>And your strife</i>

1178
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:21,052
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

1179
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:24,681
<i>Old Mother Nature's recipes</i>

1180
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:29,018
<i>That bring the bare
necessities of life</i>

1181
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:35,900
<i>Wherever I wander
Wherever I roam</i>

1182
01:42:37,235 --> 01:42:40,321
<i>I couldn't be fonder</i>

1183
01:42:40,405 --> 01:42:42,782
<i>Of my big home</i>

1184
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,535
<i>The bees are buzzing</i>

1185
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:47,328
<i>In the tree</i>

1186
01:42:47,412 --> 01:42:50,582
<i>To make some honey just for me</i>

1187
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:54,752
<i>When you look under
the rocks and plants</i>

1188
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,922
<i>And take a glance at them fancy ants</i>

1189
01:42:58,131 --> 01:43:00,341
<i>And then maybe try a few</i>

1190
01:43:00,592 --> 01:43:03,928
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

1191
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:06,514
<i>They'll come to you!</i>

1192
01:43:07,015 --> 01:43:11,561
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

1193
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:14,606
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

1194
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:17,275
<i>Forget about your worries</i>

1195
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:18,943
<i>And your strife</i>

1196
01:43:20,278 --> 01:43:24,449
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

1197
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:27,827
<i>That's why a bear can rest at ease</i>

1198
01:43:27,994 --> 01:43:32,290
<i>With just the bare necessities of life</i>

1199
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:36,044
<i>So just relax</i>

1200
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:39,297
<i>In my backyard</i>

1201
01:43:40,298 --> 01:43:42,967
<i>If you act like that bee acts</i>

1202
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:46,554
<i>You're working too hard</i>

1203
01:43:47,055 --> 01:43:50,225
<i>Don't spend your time
just looking around</i>

1204
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:54,646
<i>For something you want
that can't be found</i>

1205
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:58,191
<i>When you find out
you can live without it</i>

1206
01:43:58,316 --> 01:44:01,569
<i>And go along not thinking about it</i>

1207
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:03,821
<i>I'll tell you something true</i>

1208
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:07,033
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

1209
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:10,745
<i>The bare necessities of life</i>

1210
01:44:11,412 --> 01:44:13,039
<i>Will come to you</i>

1211
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:18,836
<i>Water, air, love</i>

1212
01:44:21,339 --> 01:44:26,052
<i>House with a roof above</i>

1213
01:44:26,678 --> 01:44:31,516
<i>Talking 'bout the bare
necessities of life</i>

1214
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:35,186
<i>Wisdom, understanding, sleep</i>

1215
01:44:37,855 --> 01:44:41,943
<i>Good health
is something you must keep</i>

1216
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:47,240
<i>Forget about
your worries and your strife</i>

1217
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:53,871
<i>These are the bare necessities of life</i>

1218
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:17,562
<i>Yeah</i>

1219
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:22,567
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
