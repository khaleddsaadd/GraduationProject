What is the main reason

390
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,766
you were all
forced underground?

391
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:15,835
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

392
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:18,370
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

393
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:19,805
Difficult situation.

394
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,207

lot of hard decisions.

396
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:24,610

neither did anyone else.

399
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:31,282
So, when you fight bad
guys like today...

400
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:33,919
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

401
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:36,522
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

402
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:39,424
They see destruction
and they see you.

403
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:40,826
