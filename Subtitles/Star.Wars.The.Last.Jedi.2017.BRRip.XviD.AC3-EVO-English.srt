1
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,336
We're not clear yet.

2
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,828
There are still 30 pallets
of cannon shells in C bunker.

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,754
Forget the munitions, there's no time.
Just get everyone on the transports.

4
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,070
Oh, no.

5
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,275
We've caught them in the middle
of their evacuation.

6
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,636
I have my orders from
Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

7
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,469
This is where we snuff out
the Resistance once and for all.

8
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,679
Tell Captain Canady
to prime his dreadnought.

9
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,358
Incinerate their base, destroy their
transports and obliterate their fleet.

10
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,756
General, Resistance ship approaching.
Guns and shields in attack mode.

11
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,189
A single light fighter.

12
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,029
Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.

13
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,416
We've pulled crazier stunts than this.

14
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,476
Just for the record,
Commander Dameron,

15
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,113
I'm with the droid on this one.

16
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,157
Thank you for your support, General.

17
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,469
Happy beeps.

18
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Attention.

19
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,656
This is Commander Poe Dameron
of the Republic fleet,

20
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,672
I have an urgent
communiqué for General Hugs.

21
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,193
Patch him through.

22
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,034
This is General Hux
of the First Order.

23
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,511
The Republic is no more.

24
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,911
Your fleet are Rebel scum
and war criminals.

25
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,554
Tell your precious princess
there will be no terms,

26
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,234
there will be no surrender.

27
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,431
Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,558
This is Hux.
You and your friends are doomed.

29
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,797
We will wipe your filth
from the galaxy.

30
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,756
Okay. I'll hold.

31
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Hello?

32
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,314
Hello? Yup. I'm still here.

33
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,798
Can he hear me?

34
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,188
- Hugs?
- He can.

35
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,591
With an "H." Skinny guy.
Kinda pasty.

36
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,077
I can hear you. Can you hear me?

37
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,040
Look, I can't hold forever.
If you reach him,

38
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,152
tell him Leia has
an urgent message for him...

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,595
I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

40
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,512
...about his mother.

41
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,393
Open fire!

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,096
BB-8, punch it!

43
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,319
He's going for the dreadnought.

44
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Ha!

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,115
He's insane.

46
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,237
Woo-hoo! That's got a kick.

47
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,397
All right, taking out the cannons now.

48
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,600
Tallie, start your approach.

49
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,800
Copy that.

50
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,238
Captain Canady,
why aren't you blasting that puny ship?

51
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,200
That puny ship is too small
and at too close range.

52
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,713
We need to scramble our fighters

53
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,918
five bloody minutes ago.

54
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,360
He'll never penetrate our armor.

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,237
He's not trying to penetrate our armor.

56
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,396
He's clearing out our surface cannons.

57
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,988
One cannon left.

58
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,479
And here comes the parade.

59
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Yeah! Yeah, I see him!

60
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,429
No, no, no. Damn it!

61
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,880
BB-8, my weapons systems are down.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,296
We gotta take out that last cannon

63
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,389
or our bombers are toast.

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,879
Work your magic, buddy.

65
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,953
Are the auto-cannons primed?

66
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Primed and ready, sir.

67
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,474
What are we waiting for?

68
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,915
Fire on the base!

69
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Punch it!

70
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
The last transport is in the air.
The evacuation is complete.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,228
You did it, Poe.

72
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,637
Now get your squad back here
so we can get out of this place.

73
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,789
No, General...

74
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,438
We can do this.
We have the chance

75
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,669
to take out a dreadnought.

76
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,312
These things are fleet killers.

77
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,520
We can't let it get away.

78
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,754
Disengage now...

79
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,718
Commander. That is an or...

80
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,631
Wipe that nervous expression
off your face, Threepio.

81
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,833
Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,149
Nervous?

83
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,313
Let's go, BB-8.

84
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,595
It's now or never!

85
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,396
Yes!

86
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,032
All clear! Bring the bombs.

87
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Captain,

88
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,557
Resistance bombers approaching.

89
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,029
Of course they are.

90
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,520
Bombers, keep that tight formation.

91
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,676
Fighters, protect the bombers.

92
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,376
It's not every day we
get a shot at a dreadnought,

93
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,435
so let's make this count.

94
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,595
Copy that, Blue Leader.

95
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
You get us there,
we'll give it to them.

96
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
- Copy. We're on it.
- Fighters incoming.

97
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,393
Gunners, look alive.

98
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,736
Snubfighters at two-ten!

99
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,896
- They're coming in!
- Form up!

100
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,319
They're everywhere!

101
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Here they come.

102
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,856
Incoming fighters. Form up.

103
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,280
Vector in at attack speed.

104
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,038
- Pull up!
- Flank right.

105
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,874
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday! We're going down!

106
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,430
Recharge the auto-cannons.

107
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,598
Target their cruiser.

108
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,310
I see it. Tallie,
they've targeted the fleet

109
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,118
and begun the priming sequence.

110
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,315
Copy that.

111
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
We're almost there.

112
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,952
Bombardiers, begin your drop sequence.

113
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
I've got a visual on the target.

114
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,594
We're approaching the sweet spot.

115
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,920
Bombs are armed.

116
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,154
- Auto-cannons aimed.
- Forty seconds to full charge.

117
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,675
Destroy that last bomber!

118
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,473
Paige, come in. We're over the target.

119
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,936
Why aren't your bay doors open?

120
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,235
You're the only bomber left.
It's all down to you!

121
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,959
- Nix!
- Paige!

122
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,951
Drop the payload now!

123
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,309
Look out!

124
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,348
No!

125
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,349
Bombs away!

126
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,996
Direct hit! Dreadnought down!

127
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,096
General, Supreme Leader Snoke

128
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,236
is making contact from his ship.

129
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Excellent.

130
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,559
I'll take it in my chambers.

131
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,754
General Hux.

132
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,832
Ah, good. Supreme Lea...

133
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,908
My disappointment

134
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,516
in your performance cannot be overstated.

135
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,830
They can't get away, Supreme Leader.

136
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,196
We have them tied on the end of a string.

137
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,355
Rey!

138
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,399
Well done, pal.

139
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,192
"Finn naked leaking bag"?
What? Did you fry a chip?

140
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,278
Finn! Finn, buddy.

141
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,513
It's so good to see you.

142
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,715
What? Let's...

143
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,957
We need to get you dressed.
Come on.

144
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,496
You must have a thousand questions.

145
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,794
Where's Rey?

146
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,398
Master Skywalker?

147
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,271
Master Skywalker?

148
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,558
I'm from the Resistance.

149
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,598
Your sister Leia sent me.
We need your help.

150
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,032
Hello?

151
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,839
Go away.

152
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,119
Chewie, what are you doing here?

153
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,280
He said you're coming back with us.

154
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
How did you find me?

155
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,232
Long story. We'll tell you on the Falcon.

156
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,793
Falcon?

157
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,799
Wait.

158
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,031
Where's Han?

159
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,954
Tied on a string indeed,
General Hux. Well done.

160
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,317
The Resistance will soon
be in our grasp.

161
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,715
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

162
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,118
You wonder why I keep a rabid cur

163
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,630
in such a place of power?

164
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,554
A cur's weakness,
properly manipulated,

165
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,429
can be a sharp tool.

166
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,272
How's your wound?

167
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,629
It's nothing.

168
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Hmm.

169
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,709
The mighty Kylo Ren.

170
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,278
When I found you,

171
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,039
I saw what all masters live to see.

172
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,079
Raw, untamed power.

173
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,678
And beyond that, something truly special.

174
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,954
The potential of your bloodline.

175
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,317
A new Vader.

176
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,554
Now I fear

177
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,879
I was mistaken.

178
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,634
I've given everything I have to you.

179
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,999
To the dark side.

180
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,072
Take that ridiculous thing off.

181
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,034
Yes, there it is.

182
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,876
You have too much
of your father's heart in you,

183
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,995
young Solo.

184
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,792
I killed Han Solo.

185
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,877
When the moment came,
I didn't hesitate.

186
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,598
And look at you,

187
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,990
the deed split your spirit to the bone.

188
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,628
You were unbalanced,

189
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,515
bested by a girl
who had never held a lightsaber!

190
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,948
You failed!

191
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,559
Skywalker lives.

192
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,470
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

193
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,517
And as long as it does,

194
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,990
hope lives in the galaxy.

195
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,433
I thought you would be the one
to snuff it out.

196
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,677
Alas, you're no Vader.

197
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,354
You're just a child

198
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,475
in a mask.

199
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,315
Prepare my ship.

200
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,032
There's no light
left in Kylo Ren.

201
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,592
He's only getting stronger.

202
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,509
The First Order will control
all the major systems within weeks.

203
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,676
We need your help.

204
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,434
We need the Jedi Order back.

205
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,195
We need Luke Skywalker.

206
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,753
You don't need Luke Skywalker.

207
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,919
Did you hear a word I just said?

208
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You think what?

209
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,796
I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword
and face down the whole First Order?

210
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,638
What did you think
was going to happen here?

211
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,755
You think that I came

212
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,038
to the most unfindable place
in the galaxy for no reason at all?

213
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,953
Go away.

214
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,317
I'm not leaving without you!

215
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,395
Careful!

216
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,953
You're wasting your time.

217
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,471
Who are you?

218
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,435
I know this place.

219
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,833
Built a thousand generations ago

220
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,909
to keep these.

221
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,279
The original Jedi texts.

222
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,310
Just like me,
they're the last of the Jedi religion.

223
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,233
You've seen this place.

224
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,277
You've seen this island.

225
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,871
Only in dreams.

226
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,877
Who are you?

227
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
The Resistance sent me.

228
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,634
They sent you?

229
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,031
What's special about you?

230
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,836
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

231
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,794
- No one's from nowhere.
- Jakku.

232
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,753
All right,
that is pretty much nowhere.

233
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,554
Why are you here, Rey,
from nowhere?

234
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,755
The Resistance sent me.

235
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,035
We need your help.

236
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,336
The First Order's become unstoppable.

237
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,999
Why are you here?

238
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,990
Something inside me has always been there.

239
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,311
But now it's awake.

240
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,759
And I'm afraid.

241
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,029
I don't know what it is

242
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,551
or what to do with it.

243
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,119
And I need help.

244
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,990
You need a teacher.

245
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,229
I can't teach you.

246
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,075
Why not?

247
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,396
I've seen your daily routine.
You're not busy.

248
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,314
I will never train
another generation of Jedi.

249
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,955
I came to this island to die.

250
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,672
It's time for the Jedi to end.

251
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,714
Why?

252
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,388
Leia sent me here with hope.

253
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,393
If she was wrong,
she deserves to know why.

254
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,754
We all do.

255
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,436
- You're demoted.
- What? Wait!

256
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,830
- We took down a dreadnought.
- At what cost?

257
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,718
You start an attack,
you follow it through.

258
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,472
Poe, get your head out of your cockpit.

259
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,677
There are things that you cannot solve

260
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,752
by jumping in an X-wing
and blowing something up!

261
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,876
I need you to learn that.

262
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,757
There were heroes on that mission.

263
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,399
Dead heroes.

264
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,559
No leaders.

265
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,951
We're really nowhere.

266
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,951
How's Rey gonna find us now?

267
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,879
A cloaked binary beacon.

268
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,553
To light her way home.

269
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,116
All right, so until she gets back,
what's the plan?

270
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,077
We need to find a new base.

271
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,275
One with enough power

272
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,109
to get a distress signal
to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.

273
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,792
Proximity alert!

274
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
They found us.

275
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,679
That's impossible.

276
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,031
That's Snoke's ship.

277
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,599
You gotta be kidding me.

278
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,496
- Can we jump to lightspeed?
- We have enough

279
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,840
fuel resources for just one jump.

280
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,336
Well, then, do it.
We gotta get out of here.

281
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,679
Wait.

282
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,360
They've tracked us through lightspeed.

283
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
That's impossible.

284
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Yes.

285
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,632
And they've done it.

286
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,896
So if we jump through lightspeed,

287
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,816
they'll just find us again
and we'll be out of fuel.

288
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
They've got us.

289
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,752
Not yet, they don't.

290
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,200
Permission to jump in an X-wing
and blow something up?

291
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,679
Permission granted.

292
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,319
Admiral, swing us around!

293
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,596
Full astern. Rotate shields!

294
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,797
To your stations! Move, move, move!

295
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Follow my lead.

296
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,114
Green Squadron to launch position.

297
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,396
Clear all launch traffic.

298
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,070
Don't wait for me!
Jump in and fire her up!

299
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,193
Technicians,
lock down supplies for launch conditions.

300
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,871
Move! Move!

301
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,039
Poe, are you all right?

302
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,395
We need to get out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

303
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,959
We need to what?

304
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,473
Full engines ahead.

305
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,315
Get out of range of the Star Destroyers
and the fighters will fall back.

306
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,152
All craft, full engines!

307
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,356
Concentrate rear shields.

308
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,876
Ren, the Resistance
have pulled out of range.

309
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,593
We can't cover you at this distance.

310
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,115
Return to the fleet.

311
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,349
What is the point of all this

312
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,910
if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?

313
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,071
Well, they're faster and lighter, sir.

314
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,120
They can't lose us,
but they can keep at a range

315
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,400
where our cannons are ineffective
against their shields.

316
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,679
Well, keep up the barrage.

317
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,308
Let's at least remind them
that we're still here.

318
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,589
Very good, sir.

319
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,150
They won't last long
burning fuel like this.

320
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,515
It's just a matter of time.

321
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,916
Move! Out of the way, everybody!
Give room!

322
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,349
Life signs are weak,
but she's fighting.

323
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Artoo?

324
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,192
Artoo!

325
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,433
Yes.

326
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,016
Yeah, I know.

327
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,470
Hey, sacred island, watch the language.

328
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,996
Old friend.

329
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,676
I wish I could make you understand.

330
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,711
But I'm not coming back.

331
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,796
Nothing can make me
change my mind.

332
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,594
Years ago, you served my father
in the Clone Wars.

333
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,520
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.

334
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,936
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person...

335
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,234
That was a cheap move.

336
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,176
...but my ship
has fallen under attack,

337
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,668
and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

338
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,756
This is our most desperate hour.

339
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,433
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

340
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,754
You're my only hope.

341
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,833
Tomorrow at dawn.

342
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,879
Three lessons.

343
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,634
I will teach you the ways of the Jedi

344
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,072
and why they need to end.

345
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,559
General Organa,

346
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,709
Leia,

347
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,553
is unconscious but recovering.

348
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,996
That's the only good news I have.

349
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,918
Admiral Ackbar,
all our leadership, they're gone.

350
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,040
Leia was the sole survivor
on the bridge.

351
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,434
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

352
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,718
If she were here, she'd say
save your sorrow for after the fight.

353
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,989
To that end,

354
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,794
the chain of command is clear
as to who should take her place.

355
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,558
Vice Admiral Holdo

356
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,752
of the cruiser Ninka.

357
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,273
Thank you, Commander.

358
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,794
Four hundred of us

359
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,473
on three ships.

360
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,594
We're the very last
of the Resistance.

361
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,830
But we're not alone.

362
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,195
In every corner of the galaxy,

363
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,158
the downtrodden and oppressed
know our symbol,

364
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,192
and they put their hope in it.

365
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,552
We are the spark

366
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,189
that will light the fire that
will restore the Republic.

367
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,711
That spark,
this Resistance, must survive.

368
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,870
That is our mission.

369
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,634
Now, to your stations.

370
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,435
And may the Force be with us.

371
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,274
That's Admiral Holdo?

372
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,316
Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo?

373
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,954
Not what I expected.

374
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,635
Vice Admiral?
Commander Dameron.

375
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,640
With our current fuel consumption,
there's a very limited amount of time

376
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,656
that we can stay out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

377
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,035
Very kind of you
to make me aware.

378
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,576
Let's get me those fuel projections.

379
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,920
And we need to shake 'em
before we can find a new base, so,

380
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,353
what's our plan?

381
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,317
Our plan, captain?

382
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,872
Not commander, right?

383
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,190
Wasn't it Leia's last official act
to demote you

384
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,713
for your dreadnought plan

385
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,715
where we lost our entire bombing fleet?

386
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,479
"Captain." "Commander."

387
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,920
You can call me whatever you like.

388
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,678
I just wanna know what's going on.

389
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,509
Of course you do.

390
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I understand.

391
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,512
I've dealt with plenty
of trigger-happy flyboys like you.

392
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
You're impulsive.

393
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,035
Dangerous.

394
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,992
And the last thing
we need right now.

395
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,953
So stick to your post
and follow my orders.

396
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,936
Turbolink banks seven and eight

397
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,837
are offline due to maintenance.

398
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,874
What are you doing here?

399
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,439
Hey. Hi.

400
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,434
Uh, I was...
You know, I was just...

401
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,828
You're Finn!

402
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,994
The Finn!

403
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,232
- The Finn?
- Sorry.

404
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,158
I work behind pipes all day.

405
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,115
Doing talking with Resistance heroes
is not my forte.

406
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,474
Doing...

407
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,755
Doing talking.

408
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,439
I'm Rose.

409
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,915
Breathe.

410
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,116
- Okay.
- Yeah.

411
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,750
Look, I'm not a Resistance hero,
but it was nice talking to you, Rose.

412
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,752
May the Force be with you.

413
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,035
Wow. You, too.

414
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,432
Okay. But you are a hero.

415
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,078
You left the First Order,
what you did on the Starkiller Base...

416
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,856
When we heard about it,
my sister Paige said,

417
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,438
"Rose, that's a real hero."

418
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,149
"Know right from wrong

419
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,200
"and don't run away
when it gets hard," she said.

420
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,376
You know...

421
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,118
Just this morning, I've had to stun

422
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,475
three people trying to
jump ship in this escape pod.

423
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,710
- What?
- They were running away.

424
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,229
That's disgraceful.

425
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,315
I know.

426
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Anyway, uh...

427
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,152
Gotta get back to
what I was doing, so...

428
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,639
What were you doing?

429
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,434
Uh, just...

430
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,400
- Doing some checks.
- Checking the escape pods.

431
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,875
- No, it's routine checks.
- By boarding one

432
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,039
with a packed bag.

433
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Okay.

434
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,976
Listen, I'm...

435
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,631
I can't move. I can't move.

436
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,677
- I know.
- What happened?

437
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,776
I'm taking you to the brig
and turning you in for desertion.

438
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,949
I was not deserting.

439
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,350
- I told you that...
- My sister just died

440
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,112
protecting the fleet.

441
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,191
And you were running away.

442
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,355
I'm sorry.

443
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
But this fleet is doomed,

444
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,070
and if my friend comes back to it,
she's doomed, too.

445
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,515
I've gotta get this...

446
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,877
I gotta get this beacon
far away from here.

447
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,393
Then she'll find me and be safe.

448
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,117
You're a selfish traitor.

449
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,280
Look, we can't outrun
the First Order fleet.

450
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,754
We can jump to lightspeed!

451
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,536
Well, they can track us
through lightspeed.

452
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,616
They can track us through lightspeed?

453
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Yeah.

454
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,776
They'd just show up
thirty seconds later

455
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,856
and we'd have
blown a ton of fuel,

456
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,996
which, by the way,
we're dangerously short on.

457
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,398
They can track us through lightspeed.

458
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Yes. And they could...

459
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
I can't feel my teeth.

460
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,199
What did you shoot me with?

461
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Active tracking.

462
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,555
What now?

463
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,416
Hyperspace tracking is new tech

464
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,954
but the principle must be
the same as any active tracker.

465
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,856
- They're only tracking us...
- Only tracking us...

466
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,154
...from the lead ship.

467
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,719
But we can't get to the tracker.

468
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,976
It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

469
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,456
Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

470
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,869
...has a dedicated power breaker.

471
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,868
But... Wait, but who knows
where the breaker room

472
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
is on a Star Destroyer?

473
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,117
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

474
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,828
If I can get us there,

475
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,151
I can shut their tracker down.

476
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,636
Just give it to me
one more time, simpler.

477
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,110
So, the First Order's only tracking us
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

478
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,349
So we blow that one up?

479
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,856
I like where your head's at, but no.

480
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,696
They'd only start tracking us
from another Destroyer.

481
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
But if we can...

482
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,056
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer
and disable the tracker

483
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,416
without them realizing, then we can...

484
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,510
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.

485
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,069
- About six minutes.
- Sneak on board.

486
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,913
Disable the tracker.

487
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,515
Our fleet escapes before they realize.

488
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,920
Hmm.

489
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
How'd you two meet?

490
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Just luck.

491
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,709
Yeah?

492
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,228
Good luck?

493
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,829
Not sure yet.

494
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,673
Poe, we gotta do this.

495
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,035
It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey.

496
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,360
If I must be
the sole voice of reason,

497
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,511
Admiral Holdo will never
agree to this plan.

498
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,314
Yeah, you're right, Threepio.

499
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,040
It's a "need-to-know" plan,
and she doesn't.

500
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,838
- That wasn't exactly my...
- All right,

501
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,353
you guys shut down that tracker.

502
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,040
I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed.

503
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
The question is,

504
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,440
how do we sneak the two of you
onto Snoke's Destroyer?

505
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,696
We steal clearance codes.

506
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,800
No, they're bio-hexacrypt
and rescrambled every hour.

507
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,120
We can't get through their
security shields undetected.

508
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,028
Nobody can.

509
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,393
Could I do it?

510
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,790
Of course I could do it.
But I can't do it.

511
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,832
I'm a little tied down right now.

512
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,194
Oh!

513
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,191
Maz? What is happening?

514
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,636
Union dispute. You do not want
to hear about it.

515
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,472
But, lucky for you,

516
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,394
there's exactly one guy I trust
who can crack that kind of security!

517
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,518
He's a master codebreaker,

518
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,712
an ace pilot,
a poet with a blaster.

519
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Oh, my.

520
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,760
It sounds like this codebreaker fellow
can do everything.

521
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,388
Oh, yes, he can.

522
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,759
You'll find him with a red
plom bloom on his lapel

523
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,514
rolling at a high stakes table

524
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,871
in the casino on Canto Bight.

525
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,032
Canto Bight? No, no. That's... Maz...

526
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,176
Is there any way that we can
take care of this ourselves?

527
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,873
Sorry, kiddo.
This is rarefied cracking.

528
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,753
You wanna get on that Destroyer,

529
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,393
I only know one option.

530
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,434
Find the Master Codebreaker.

531
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,149
You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me.

532
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,635
You're not doing this.
The effort would kill you.

533
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,760
Can you see my surroundings?

534
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,393
You're gonna pay for what you did!

535
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,834
I can't see yours.

536
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,714
Just you.

537
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,359
So, no.

538
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,355
This is something else.

539
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,320
Luke.

540
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,432
What's that about?

541
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,429
I was cleaning my blaster.
It went off.

542
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,629
Let's get started.

543
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,279
Who were those things?

544
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,399
Caretakers.

545
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,675
Island natives.

546
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,229
They've kept up the Jedi structures
since they were built.

547
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,518
I don't think they like me.

548
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,352
Can't imagine why.

549
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,639
Master Skywalker,

550
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,456
we need you to bring the Jedi back

551
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,278
because Kylo Ren is strong
with the dark side of the Force.

552
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,908
Without the Jedi, we won't
stand a chance against him.

553
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,389
What do you know
about the Force?

554
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,753
It's a power that Jedi have
that lets them control people

555
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,913
and make things float.

556
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Impressive.

557
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,116
Every word in that sentence was wrong.

558
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,871
Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed.

559
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,792
The Force is not a power you have.

560
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,269
It's not about lifting rocks.

561
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,471
It's the energy between all things,

562
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,710
a tension, a balance,

563
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,155
that binds the universe together.

564
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,320
Okay.

565
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,629
But what is it?

566
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,314
Close your eyes.

567
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,593
Breathe.

568
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,320
Now,

569
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,909
reach out.

570
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,715
I feel something.

571
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,896
- You feel it?
- Yes, I feel it.

572
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,040
- That's the Force.
- Really?

573
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,696
Wow, it must be
really strong with you.

574
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,720
I've never felt any...

575
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,880
Ow!

576
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,948
You meant reach out like...

577
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,600
I'll try again.

578
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,120
Breathe.

579
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,237
Just breathe.

580
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,630
Reach out with your feelings.

581
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,194
What do you see?

582
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,280
The island.

583
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,235
Life.

584
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,919
Death and decay,

585
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,913
that feeds new life.

586
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,635
Warmth.

587
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,760
Cold.

588
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,439
Peace.

589
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,314
Violence.

590
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,839
And between it all?

591
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,640
Balance.

592
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,628
An energy.

593
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,273
A Force.

594
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,512
And inside you?

595
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,272
Inside me

596
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,510
that same Force.

597
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,798
And this is the lesson.

598
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,077
That Force does not
belong to the Jedi.

599
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,113
To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, is vanity.

600
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,436
Can you feel that?

601
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,838
There's something else

602
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,313
beneath the island.

603
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,240
A place.

604
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,749
A dark place.

605
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,995
Balance.

606
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,591
Powerful light, powerful darkness.

607
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,075
It's cold.

608
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,909
It's calling me.

609
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,275
Resist it, Rey.

610
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,594
Rey?

611
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Rey!

612
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,837
You went straight to the dark.

613
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,880
That place was trying
to show me something.

614
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,751
It offered something you needed.

615
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,669
And you didn't even try
to stop yourself.

616
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,432
But I didn't see you.

617
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,072
Nothing from you.

618
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,829
You've closed yourself off
from the Force.

619
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,753
Of course you have.

620
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,192
I've seen this raw strength
only once before,

621
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,472
in Ben Solo.

622
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,358
It didn't scare me enough then.

623
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,073
It does now.

624
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,480
What was that?

625
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,834
Nothing, admiral.

626
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,393
Passing debris.

627
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,551
The fleet's only got
18 hours of fuel left.

628
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,279
We gotta hurry.

629
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,556
Still can't reach the Resistance?

630
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,312
Keep at it.

631
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,158
If you get through, check their status.

632
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,639
And ask about Finn.

633
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,796
Why is the Force connecting us?

634
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,160
You and I.

635
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,719
Murderous snake.

636
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,517
You're too late.
You lost. I found Skywalker.

637
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,000
Did he tell you what happened?

638
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,550
The night I destroyed his temple,
did he tell you why?

639
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,314
I know everything
I need to know about you.

640
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,993
You do?

641
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,471
Ah, you do.

642
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,671
You have that look in your eyes.

643
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,637
From the forest.

644
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,548
When you called me a monster.

645
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,836
You are a monster.

646
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,433
Yes, I am.

647
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,760
Okay.

648
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,190
We get in, we find this codebreaker,
we get out.

649
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,555
You know this town? Canto Bight?

650
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,914
From stories.

651
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,516
It's a terrible place filled with
the worst people in the galaxy.

652
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,640
Great.

653
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,518
I told those two, I said,

654
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,353
"This is a public beach.
You can't park that shuttle here."

655
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,114
But they just lit off toward the casino.

656
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,673
Place your bets. Place your bets.

657
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,632
All bets on the table
right now, right now!

658
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,795
Place your bets here.

659
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,557
Aw, yes!
This place is great!

660
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,519
Okay.

661
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,389
Maz said this Master Codebreaker
would have a red plom bloom on his lapel.

662
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,312
Let's find him and get out of here.

663
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,516
Well played. The house wins.

664
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,856
Where are
your manners, more like?

665
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,949
Come on!

666
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,776
We've covered this whole casino.

667
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Zero red plom blooms.

668
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,520
Where is this guy?

669
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,952
Were those what I think they were?

670
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,151
- What are those things?
- Fathiers.

671
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,593
I've never seen a real one.

672
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,919
Look, this whole place is beautiful.
I mean, come on.

673
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,318
Why do you hate it so much?

674
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,554
Look closer.

675
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,593
My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

676
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,516
The First Order stripped our ore
to finance their military

677
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,036
then shelled us
to test their weapons.

678
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,150
They took everything we had.

679
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,040
And who do you think
these people are?

680
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,956
There's only one business in the galaxy
that'll get you this rich.

681
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,755
War.

682
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,595
Selling weapons to the First Order.

683
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,355
I wish I could put my fist through this
whole lousy, beautiful town.

684
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,835
Red plom bloom!

685
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,115
Red plom bloom!

686
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,469
The Master Codebreaker!

687
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,398
Yep, those are the shuttle parkers.

688
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,600
All right.

689
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,157
You two are under arrest
for parking violation 27B/6.

690
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,376
You have the right to remain...

691
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,516
- What was that?
- No, no, no. Not now, Lovey.

692
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,635
I'm on a roll.

693
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,033
Lesson two.

694
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,392
Now that they're extinct,
the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

695
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,633
But if you strip away the myth
and look at their deeds,

696
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,156
the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

697
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,629
Hypocrisy, hubris.

698
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,760
That's not true.

699
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,520
At the height of their powers,
they allowed Darth Sidious to rise

700
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,517
create the Empire, and wipe them out.

701
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,831
It was a Jedi Master
who was responsible

702
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,117
for the training
and creation of Darth Vader.

703
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,793
And a Jedi who saved him.

704
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,038
Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.

705
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,395
But you saw there was conflict inside him.

706
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,194
You believed that he wasn't gone.
That he could be turned.

707
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,232
And I became a legend.

708
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,750
For many years, there was balance

709
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,319
and then I saw

710
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,600
Ben.

711
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,715
My nephew
with that mighty Skywalker blood.

712
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,233
And in my hubris,

713
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,551
I thought I could train him,
I could pass on my strengths.

714
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,070
Han was Han about it, but...

715
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,153
Leia

716
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,955
trusted me with her son.

717
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,760
I took him,

718
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,552
and a dozen students,

719
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,113
and began a training temple.

720
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,271
By the time I realized

721
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,597
I was no match for
the darkness rising in him,

722
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,758
it was too late.

723
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,433
What happened?

724
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,359
I went to confront him.

725
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,312
And he turned on me.

726
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,199
Ben, no!

727
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,436
He must have thought
I was dead.

728
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,348
When I came to,

729
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,112
the temple was burning.

730
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,233
He had vanished
with a handful of my students.

731
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,515
And slaughtered the rest.

732
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,951
Leia blamed Snoke,

733
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,868
but it was me.

734
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,999
I failed.

735
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,557
Because I was Luke Skywalker.

736
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,391
Jedi Master.

737
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,392
A legend.

738
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,875
The galaxy may need a legend.

739
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,758
I need someone to show me
my place in all this.

740
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,318
And you didn't fail Kylo.

741
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,158
Kylo failed you.

742
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,552
I won't.

743
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,073
The main cruiser's
still keeping beyond range.

744
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,391
But their medical frigate is out of fuel

745
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,272
and its shields are down.

746
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,317
The beginning of their end.

747
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,552
Destroy it.

748
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,910
The last of our crew has been evacuated
and heading your way.

749
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,598
It's been an honor, admiral.

750
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,637
Godspeed, Rebels!

751
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,035
Admiral,

752
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,716
fuel reserves at six hours.

753
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,556
Maintain our current course.

754
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,072
Steady on.

755
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,160
Finn,

756
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,436
Rose, where are you guys?

757
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,949
Deal me in.

758
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,080
Thanks.

759
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,237
Finn, the fleet
is running on fumes.

760
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,873
Without a codebreaker
to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer...

761
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,672
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

762
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,834
Unless you got a thief in your pocket,
our plan is shot.

763
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,239
Um, I can do it.

764
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,400
What?

765
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,195
What?

766
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,160
What?

767
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,912
S-S-Sorry, I just

768
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,356
couldn't help but overhear all the stuff

769
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,398
that you were saying really loudly

770
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,433
while I was trying to sleep.

771
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,039
Codebreaker?

772
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,433
Thief?

773
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,594
I can do it.

774
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,513
We're not talking about
picking pockets, okay?

775
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,471
Yeah.

776
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,396
D-D-Don't let the wrapper
fool you, friend.

777
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,635
Me and the First Order
codeage go way back.

778
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,595
And,

779
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,197
if the price is right,

780
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,355
I could break you into
old man S-S-Snoke's boudoir.

781
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,037
- No.
- We're... We got it covered.

782
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,954
Ha-tuk-ga.

783
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,192
- Did he just...
- Yeah.

784
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,398
We gotta get out of here!
This way!

785
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,629
Why you little...

786
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,557
D-D-Did you do this?

787
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,715
Hey, hands up!

788
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,110
- Hands up!
- Yeah, man.

789
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,832
What's your story, roundie?

790
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,629
They went this way!

791
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,391
- Lock down all the exits.
- Wait.

792
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,552
That smelled great.

793
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,551
Those cops will be here
any minute. What now?

794
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,918
Whoa! Ooh!

795
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,598
No, wait. Please, don't!

796
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,280
We're with the Resistance.

797
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,196
Roger that.
Checking the stables now.

798
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,120
This way.

799
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,480
They must have
come through here.

800
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,360
Hyah!

801
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,231
Go, go, go! Whoo!

802
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,880
Stop enjoying this!
Stop enjoying this!

803
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,641
We've got them.
They're not going anywhere.

804
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,680
Ahhh!

805
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,760
Huh?

806
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,520
Move, move, move!
Get out of the way!

807
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,510
Our ship's on the beach straight ahead!

808
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,520
We need cover!

809
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,674
Too much cover!

810
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,315
There it is!

811
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,831
- No!
- Come on!

812
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,160
Let the herd go.
Stick with the perps.

813
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,675
Where'd they go?

814
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,989
I think we lost him!

815
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,976
Now we get down to the beach
and circle back around...

816
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Cliff!

817
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,195
We're trapped.

818
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,354
It was worth it, though.

819
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,274
To tear up that town,

820
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,868
make 'em hurt.

821
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,480
Go.

822
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,748
Now it's worth it.

823
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,240
There they are.

824
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,194
BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?

825
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,234
Ah.

826
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,912
N-N-Need a lift?

827
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,800
Luke.

828
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,269
Leia.

829
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,997
I'd rather not do this now.

830
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,033
Yeah, me, too.

831
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,992
Why did you hate your father?

832
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,440
Do you have something,

833
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,040
a cowl or something you could put on?

834
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,995
Why did you hate your father?
Give me an honest answer.

835
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,114
You had a father who loved you,
he gave a damn about you.

836
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,356
- I didn't hate him.
- Then why?

837
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,760
Why what?

838
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,713
Why what? Say it.

839
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,359
Why did you...

840
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,116
Why did you kill him?

841
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,754
I don't understand.

842
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,920
No?

843
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,680
Your parents threw you away
like garbage.

844
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,950
- They didn't!
- They did.

845
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,917
But you can't stop needing them.

846
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,308
It's your greatest weakness.

847
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,280
Looking for them everywhere,

848
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,594
in Han Solo,

849
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,877
now in Skywalker.

850
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,077
Did he tell you what happened
that night?

851
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,440
Yes.

852
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,589
No.

853
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,998
He had sensed my power,

854
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,038
as he senses yours.

855
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,992
And he feared it.

856
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,114
Liar.

857
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,913
Let the past die.

858
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,829
Kill it if you have to.

859
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,119
That's the only way to become
what you were meant to be.

860
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,231
No! No!

861
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,119
Rey?

862
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,873
I should have felt
trapped or panicked.

863
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,519
But I didn't.

864
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,960
This didn't go on forever,

865
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,150
I knew it was leading somewhere.

866
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,388
And that, at the end,
it would show me what I came to see.

867
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,959
Rey.

868
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,675
Let me see them.

869
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,151
My parents,

870
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,390
please.

871
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,590
I thought I'd find answers here.

872
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,553
I was wrong.

873
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,872
I'd never felt so alone.

874
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,799
You're not alone.

875
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,239
Neither are you.

876
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,599
Rey?

877
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,072
It isn't too late.

878
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,835
Stop!

879
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,112
Is it true?
Did you try to murder him?

880
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,714
Leave this island now!

881
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,074
Stop.

882
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,360
Stop!

883
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,989
Did you do it?

884
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,191
Did you create Kylo Ren?

885
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,760
Tell me the truth.

886
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,636
I saw darkness.

887
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,351
I'd sensed it building in him.

888
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,159
I'd seen it in moments
during his training.

889
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,511
But then I looked inside,

890
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,713
and it was beyond
what I ever imagined.

891
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,110
Snoke had already turned his heart.

892
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,553
He would bring destruction,
and pain, and death,

893
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,677
and the end of everything I love
because of what he will become.

894
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,637
And for the briefest moment
of pure instinct,

895
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,995
I thought I could stop it.

896
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,548
It passed like a fleeting shadow.

897
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,317
And I was left with shame,

898
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,596
and with consequence.

899
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,237
And the last thing I saw

900
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,671
were the eyes of a frightened boy

901
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,228
whose master had failed him.

902
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,920
Ben, no!

903
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,956
You failed him by thinking
his choice was made.

904
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,040
It wasn't.

905
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,277
There's still conflict in him.

906
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,079
If he were turned from the dark side,
that could shift the tide.

907
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,992
This could be how we win.

908
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:03,152
This is not going to go
the way you think.

909
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,908
It is.

910
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,873
Just now when we touched hands,

911
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,314
I saw his future.

912
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,958
As solid as I'm seeing you.

913
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,955
If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

914
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,275
Rey,

915
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,830
don't do this.

916
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,312
Then he's our last hope.

917
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,833
Master Yoda.

918
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,114
Young Skywalker.

919
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,833
I'm ending all of this.

920
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,628
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

921
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,994
I'm gonna burn it down.

922
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,989
Hmm.

923
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,833
Ah, Skywalker.

924
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,955
Missed you, have I.

925
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,798
So it is time

926
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,157
for the Jedi Order to end.

927
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,550
Time it is.

928
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,639
Hmm.

929
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:41,877
For you to look past
a pile of old books, hmm?

930
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,712
The sacred Jedi texts.

931
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,030
Oh. Read them, have you?

932
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,193
- Well, I...
- Page-turners

933
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,628
they were not.

934
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,157
Yes, yes, yes.

935
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,679
Wisdom they held,

936
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,310
but that library contained
nothing that the girl Rey

937
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,391
does not already possess.

938
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,232
Skywalker,

939
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,071
still looking to the horizon.

940
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,708
Never here, now, hmm?

941
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,480
The need in front of your nose.

942
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,280
Hmm?

943
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,798
I was weak.

944
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,040
Unwise.

945
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,760
Lost Ben Solo, you did.

946
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,914
Lose Rey, we must not.

947
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,158
I can't be what she needs me to be.

948
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,995
Heeded my words not, did you?

949
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,954
Pass on what you have learned.

950
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,236
Strength, mastery.

951
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,792
But weakness,

952
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,349
folly, failure also.

953
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,637
Yes, failure most of all.

954
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,758
The greatest teacher, failure is.

955
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,080
Luke,

956
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,070
we are what they grow beyond.

957
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,038
That is the true burden of all masters.

958
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,236
Four parsecs to go.
This thing really cooks.

959
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,072
I just hope we're in time.

960
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,639
You can actually do this, right?

961
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,191
Yeah, about that...

962
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,396
Guys, I can do it.

963
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,039
But there exists a pre- "do it"
conversation about price.

964
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,320
Once we're done, the Resistance
will give you whatever you want.

965
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,080
What you got deposit-wise?

966
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,155
Are you kidding me?
Look at us.

967
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,992
Is that Haysian smelt?

968
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,959
That's something.

969
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,315
No, we gave you our word.
You're gonna get paid.

970
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,634
That should be enough.

971
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,074
Guys, I wanna keep helping.

972
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,670
But no something, n-n-no doing.

973
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,831
Okay, listen here, you've got...

974
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,038
Do it.

975
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,877
Now I can help.

976
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,429
Give it back.

977
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:21,920
What?

978
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,070
Give it back!

979
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,360
You have no idea how much
that medallion means to her.

980
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,717
What are you... Why are you
ransacking your own ship?

981
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,229
It's not your ship.

982
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,075
He says I stole it.

983
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,435
- Yeah, I got that.
- We stole it.

984
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,590
At least you're stealing
from the bad guys

985
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,240
and helping the good.

986
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,356
Good guys, bad guys,

987
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,556
made-up words.

988
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,829
Let's see who formerly owned
this gorgeous hunk-uh.

989
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,155
Ah, this guy was an arms dealer.

990
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,157
Made his bank selling weapons
to the bad guys.

991
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,880
Oh...

992
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,959
And the good.

993
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,312
Finn, let me learn you something big.

994
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,836
It's all a machine, partner.

995
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,353
Live free, don't join.

996
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,789
That was the last of their support ships.

997
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,320
It's just their main cruiser now.

998
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,079
And their fuel reserve?

999
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,958
By our calculation,

1000
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,599
critical.

1001
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,840
She in there?

1002
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,016
The admiral's banned you
from the bridge.

1003
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,520
- Let's not have a scene.
- No, let's.

1004
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,471
- Holdo?
- You're not allowed in here.

1005
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,989
- Flyboy.
- Cut it, lady.

1006
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,798
We had a fleet,
now we're down to one ship,

1007
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,598
and you've told us nothing!

1008
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,311
Tell us that we have a plan!

1009
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,480
That there's hope!

1010
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,039
When I served under Leia,

1011
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,668
she would say,
hope is like the sun.

1012
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,354
If you only believe in it
when you can see it...

1013
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,750
You'll never make it
through the night.

1014
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,519
Yes.

1015
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,636
Are you fueling up the transports?

1016
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,434
You are.

1017
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,388
All of them?

1018
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,274
We're abandoning ship? Is that...

1019
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,680
That's what you got?
That's what you brought us to?

1020
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,280
Coward!

1021
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,038
Those transport ships
are unarmed, unshielded.

1022
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,475
We abandon this cruiser, we're done.

1023
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,359
We don't stand a chance.
No, you are not just a coward,

1024
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,033
you are a traitor.

1025
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,990
Get this man off my bridge.

1026
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,176
Finn,
Holdo's loading the crew in the shuttle.

1027
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,997
She's going to abandon ship.
Where are you?

1028
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,878
Poe, we're on our way
back to the fleet.

1029
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,189
We're so close.

1030
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,536
Did you find the Master Codebreaker?

1031
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,676
Well, we found a codebreaker.

1032
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,256
We can shut the tracker down.

1033
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,271
Just buy us a little more time.

1034
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,998
All right. Hurry.

1035
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,080
As soon as I launch,
you jump back out of range.

1036
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,873
Stay there until you get my signal
for where to rendezvous.

1037
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,478
If you see Finn before I do,

1038
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,560
tell him...

1039
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,512
Yeah, perfect. Tell him that.

1040
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,829
Cloaking our approach.
We should be off their scopes.

1041
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,949
Then we slice a slit in their shield.

1042
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,758
Blip bloppity bloop,

1043
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,756
and slip right through.

1044
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,317
So a stormtrooper
and a who now are doing what?

1045
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,629
They are trying to save us.

1046
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,392
This is our best chance for escape.

1047
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,656
You have to give Finn and Rose
all the time that you can.

1048
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,035
You have bet the survival
of the Resistance

1049
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,953
on bad odds and put us all at risk.

1050
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,269
There's no time now.

1051
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,536
We have to get clear of the cruiser.
Load the transports.

1052
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,616
Right away, admiral.

1053
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,816
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

1054
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,796
Vice Admiral Holdo,

1055
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,677
I am relieving you
of your command

1056
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:40,116
for the survival of this ship,
its crew, and the Resistance.

1057
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,230
I hope you understand
what you're doing.

1058
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,760
Yeah.

1059
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,256
I'm going to the bridge.

1060
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,271
If they move, stun them.

1061
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,952
...at least three cycles so far.

1062
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,800
Yes, sir. We are working on it.

1063
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,751
I will do my best, sir.

1064
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,154
Almost there.

1065
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,072
You don't have to do this.

1066
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,232
I feel the conflict in you.

1067
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,118
It's tearing you apart.

1068
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,515
Ben, when we touched hands,

1069
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,193
I saw your future.

1070
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,789
Just the shape of it,
but solid and clear.

1071
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,590
You will not bow before Snoke.

1072
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,198
You'll turn.

1073
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,078
I'll help you.

1074
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,153
I saw it.

1075
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,958
I saw something, too.

1076
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,400
Because of what I saw,

1077
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,994
I know when the moment comes,
you'll be the one to turn.

1078
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,517
You'll stand with me.

1079
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,200
Rey,

1080
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,709
I saw who your parents are.

1081
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,912
Well done, my good
and faithful apprentice.

1082
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,278
My faith in you is restored.

1083
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,630
Young Rey.

1084
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,318
Welcome.

1085
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,954
So this is it.

1086
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,997
The tracker's right behind this door.

1087
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,316
Haysian smelt.

1088
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,159
Best conductor.

1089
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,273
And you're welcome.

1090
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,256
Good time to figure out
how we get back to the fleet?

1091
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,952
I know where the nearest escape pods are.

1092
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,040
Course you do.

1093
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,917
BB-8, tell me something good.

1094
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,994
Poe, we're almost there.

1095
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,496
Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.

1096
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,750
Yeah, I'm on it, pal. You just hurry.

1097
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,016
Clear the bridge, escort the
officers down to the hangar.

1098
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,553
Commander... Captain Dameron,

1099
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,517
Admiral Holdo was looking for you.

1100
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,829
Yeah, we spoke.

1101
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,510
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.

1102
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,511
Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that.

1103
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,280
Seal that door!

1104
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,120
We're running out of time.

1105
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,428
Come on, how's it going?

1106
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,158
Almost there.

1107
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,031
Threepio, where do you think
you're going?

1108
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,191
It would be quite against
my programming

1109
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,078
- to be party to a mutiny.
- Hey!

1110
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,071
It is not correct protocol.

1111
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,354
Oh! Neither is this!

1112
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,396
Finn? We're ready to make the jump!

1113
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,828
Now or never.

1114
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,799
Now.

1115
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,840
You're up.

1116
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,896
- You there, hands up!
- Watch 'em, watch 'em.

1117
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,016
- Drop your weapons, now!
- Hands up, Rebel scum.

1118
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,712
Get down! I said, down!

1119
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,277
FN-2187.

1120
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,515
So good to have you back.

1121
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,475
They didn't make it.

1122
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,515
Leia.

1123
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,456
Please board the transports

1124
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,755
according to your
evacuation designation.

1125
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,976
All transports must be cleared...

1126
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,536
Okay,
help me push him up, guys.

1127
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,039
That one's a troublemaker.

1128
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,908
I like him.

1129
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,675
Me, too.

1130
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,391
Now, time to board your transport.

1131
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,198
For the transports to escape,

1132
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:18,158
someone needs to stay behind
and pilot the cruiser.

1133
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,318
Too many losses.

1134
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,116
I can't take any more.

1135
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,754
Sure you can.

1136
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,196
You taught me how.

1137
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,914
May the Force be...

1138
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,678
You go on. I've said it enough.

1139
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,910
May the Force be with you always.

1140
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,976
Cloaking device activated.

1141
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,831
We should be off their scopes.

1142
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,389
Let's hope this works.

1143
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,315
Come closer, child.

1144
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,634
So much strength.

1145
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,072
Darkness rises,

1146
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:29,989
and light to meet it.

1147
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,833
I warned my young apprentice
that as he grew stronger,

1148
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,720
his equal in the light would rise.

1149
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,389
Skywalker...

1150
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,311
I assumed.

1151
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,400
Wrongly.

1152
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,437
Closer, I said.

1153
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,992
You underestimate Skywalker,

1154
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,835
and Ben Solo,

1155
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,794
and me.

1156
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,311
It will be your downfall.

1157
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,589
Oh...

1158
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,871
Have you seen something?

1159
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,278
A weakness in my apprentice.

1160
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,431
Is that why you came?

1161
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,872
Young fool.

1162
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:22,755
It was I who bridged your minds.

1163
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,556
I stoked Ren's conflicted soul.

1164
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,837
I knew he was not strong enough
to hide it from you.

1165
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,233
And you were not wise enough
to resist the bait.

1166
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,119
And now,

1167
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:45,515
you will give me Skywalker.

1168
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,154
Then I will kill you

1169
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,033
with the cruelest stroke.

1170
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,880
No.

1171
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,748
Yes.

1172
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,473
Give me

1173
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,518
everything.

1174
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,752
No! No!

1175
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,275
No!

1176
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:17,998
No. No.

1177
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,354
No, no, no!

1178
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,349
Poe.

1179
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,080
What is that?

1180
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,037
The mineral planet, Crait.

1181
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,555
An uncharted hideout from
the days of the Rebellion.

1182
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,957
- That's a Rebel base?
- Abandoned,

1183
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,440
but heavily armored

1184
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,600
with enough power

1185
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,056
to get a distress signal to our allies

1186
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,229
scattered in the Outer Rim.

1187
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,197
Holdo knew the First Order

1188
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,509
was tracking our big ship.

1189
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,513
They're not monitoring
for little transports.

1190
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,235
So we could slip down
to the surface unnoticed

1191
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,676
and hide till the First Order passes.

1192
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,909
That could work.

1193
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,516
She was more interested

1194
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,995
in protecting the light than she was

1195
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,028
seeming like a hero.

1196
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,274
Godspeed,

1197
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,993
Rebels.

1198
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,073
Well done, Phasma.

1199
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,953
Your ship and payment, as we agreed.

1200
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,432
You lying snake.

1201
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,555
We got caught,

1202
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,310
I cut a d-d-deal.

1203
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,155
Wait,

1204
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,159
cut a deal with what?

1205
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,280
Sir, we checked on the
information from the thief.

1206
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,874
We ran a decloaking scan,
and sure enough,

1207
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,440
30 Resistance transports
have just launched from the cruiser.

1208
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,710
He told us the truth.

1209
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,192
Will wonders never cease?

1210
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,400
No.

1211
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,840
Our weapons are ready?

1212
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,353
Ready and aimed, sir.

1213
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,838
Fire at will.

1214
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,073
Wait. No, no. No, you can't!

1215
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:45,993
No!

1216
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,752
Admiral, we're taking fire!

1217
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,496
- Do we turn around?
- No, you're too far out.

1218
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,158
Full speed to planetfall.

1219
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,320
Full speed!

1220
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:14,156
Well, well,

1221
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:17,994
I did not expect Skywalker
to be so wise.

1222
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,160
We will give him and the Jedi Order

1223
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,715
the death he desires.

1224
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,588
After the Rebels are gone,

1225
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,239
we will go to his planet

1226
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:31,234
and obliterate the entire island.

1227
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,439
Such spunk.

1228
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,235
Look here now.

1229
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:53,708
The entire Resistance
on those transports...

1230
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:58,069
Soon they will all be gone.

1231
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,557
For you, all is lost.

1232
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,593
Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope.

1233
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:14,391
You have the spirit of a true Jedi!

1234
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,199
And because of that,

1235
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,719
you must die.

1236
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,670
My worthy apprentice,

1237
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,594
son of darkness,
heir apparent to Lord Vader.

1238
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,196
Where there was conflict,
I now sense resolve.

1239
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,073
Where there was weakness, strength.

1240
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,472
Complete your training,

1241
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,191
and fulfill your destiny.

1242
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,112
I know what I have to do.

1243
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,275
Ben.

1244
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,155
You think you can turn him?

1245
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,517
Pathetic child.

1246
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,469
I cannot be betrayed,

1247
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,716
I cannot be beaten.

1248
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,235
I see his mind,

1249
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,472
I see his every intent.

1250
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,560
Yes.

1251
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:29,757
I see him turning
the lightsaber to strike true.

1252
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,389
And now,

1253
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,077
foolish child,

1254
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,196
he ignites it,

1255
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,389
and kills his true enemy!

1256
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,240
Come on, give it full thrusters.
Full speed!

1257
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,799
I am, sir.

1258
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,993
You murdering bastard!

1259
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:31,790
T-T-Take it easy, Big F.

1260
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,073
They blow you up today,
you blow them up tomorrow.

1261
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,438
It's just business.

1262
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,194
You're wrong.

1263
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,915
Maybe.

1264
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,400
Ben!

1265
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,829
The fleet.

1266
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,040
Order them to stop firing.

1267
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,957
There's still time to save the fleet.

1268
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,749
Ben?

1269
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,916
It's time to let old things die.

1270
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,754
Snoke,

1271
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,194
Skywalker.

1272
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,593
The Sith,

1273
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,111
the Jedi, the Rebels...

1274
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:13,633
Let it all die.

1275
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,315
Rey.

1276
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,839
I want you to join me.

1277
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,360
We can rule together
and bring a new order to the galaxy.

1278
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,919
Don't do this, Ben.

1279
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,149
Please don't go this way.

1280
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,790
No, no. You're still
holding on! Let go!

1281
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,235
Do you wanna know the truth
about your parents?

1282
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,639
Or have you always known?

1283
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,798
And you've just hidden it away.

1284
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,353
You know the truth.

1285
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,633
Say it.

1286
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:50,988
Say it.

1287
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,513
They were nobody.

1288
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,318
They were filthy junk traders

1289
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,391
who sold you off for drinking money.

1290
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:03,557
They're dead in a paupers'
grave in the Jakku desert.

1291
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,276
You have no place in this story.

1292
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,431
You come from nothing.
You're nothing.

1293
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:14,034
But not to me.

1294
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,120
Join me.

1295
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,635
Please.

1296
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,040
Sir,

1297
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:08,393
the Resistance cruiser's
preparing to jump to lightspeed.

1298
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,269
It's empty.

1299
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,280
They're just trying
to pull our attention away.

1300
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,869
Pathetic.

1301
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,230
Keep your fire on the transports.

1302
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,799
Execution by blaster
is too good for them.

1303
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,996
Let's make this hurt.

1304
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,720
Finn.

1305
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,952
On my command.

1306
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,034
She's running away.

1307
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:11,309
No, she isn't.

1308
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:28,198
- No!
- Fire on that cruiser!

1309
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:43,040
Execute.

1310
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,229
Finn!

1311
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,278
There's a shuttle back that way!
We gotta go!

1312
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,113
Traitor!

1313
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,800
What?

1314
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,120
Finn!

1315
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,272
You are a bug in the system.

1316
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,834
Let's go, chrome dome.

1317
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,635
Come on!

1318
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,320
No!

1319
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,280
Hey.

1320
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,879
You were always scum.

1321
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:25,953
Rebel scum.

1322
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,670
Hey! Need a lift?

1323
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,556
What happened?

1324
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,832
The girl murdered Snoke.

1325
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,633
What happened?

1326
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:32,360
She took Snoke's escape craft.

1327
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,159
We know where she's going.

1328
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,040
Get all our forces down
to that Resistance base.

1329
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,793
Let's finish this.

1330
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,749
Finish this?

1331
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,430
Who do you think you're talking to?

1332
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:46,394
You presume to command my army?

1333
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:50,516
Our Supreme Leader is dead!
We have no ruler!

1334
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:58,350
The Supreme Leader is dead.

1335
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:03,437
Long live the Supreme Leader.

1336
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,430
They're coming, shut the door.

1337
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,872
Incoming!

1338
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,357
Go! Go! Move!

1339
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:41,276
Get that shield door down!

1340
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,496
No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us!

1341
01:56:58,520 --> 01:56:59,555
No! Don't shoot!

1342
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,720
Hold your fire!

1343
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,916
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire!

1344
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:06,708
- Finn?
- Finn!

1345
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:08,918
Rose! You're not dead!

1346
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:10,314
Where's my droid?

1347
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:12,635
Buddy!

1348
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,314
I'm so glad to see you!

1349
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,870
Wait, what?
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

1350
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,314
Is this all that's left?

1351
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,961
All right, shields are up
so they can't hit us from orbit.

1352
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,520
Use whatever power we've got left

1353
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,636
to broadcast a distress signal
to the Outer Rim.

1354
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,472
Use my personal code.

1355
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,793
If there are any allies to the Resistance,

1356
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,475
it's now or never.

1357
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,111
Rose, what do you got?

1358
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:50,195
Rotting munitions, rusted artillery,
some half-gutted skim speeders.

1359
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,360
Well,

1360
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:53,793
let's just pray that big-ass door

1361
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,195
holds long enough for us
to get help.

1362
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,277
A battering ram cannon.

1363
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,078
A what now?

1364
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:11,919
Miniaturized Death Star tech.

1365
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,832
It'll crack that door open like an egg.

1366
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,400
There has to be a back way
out of here, right?

1367
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:19,357
BB-8, what do you got?

1368
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:23,357
BB-8 has analyzed
the mine's schematics.

1369
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,637
This is the only way in or out.

1370
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Come on.

1371
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,228
We have allies.

1372
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:39,311
People believe in Leia.

1373
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,558
They'll get our message, they'll come.

1374
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,350
But we have to buy time.

1375
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:47,993
We gotta take out that cannon.

1376
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:53,280
On me! On me!

1377
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,480
Move! Move!

1378
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,153
Go back! Gather your weapons!

1379
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,753
Get over here!

1380
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,960
Hold your fire!

1381
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,200
Salt.

1382
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,760
Ground forces, incoming.

1383
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,472
Copy that. On our way.

1384
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,029
Engage your mono-ski.

1385
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:41,758
The green toggle.

1386
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,949
All right, listen up.

1387
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:56,277
I don't like these rust buckets
and I don't like our odds, but...

1388
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,079
What the hell?

1389
01:59:58,240 --> 01:59:59,514
Just keep it tight

1390
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:02,638
and don't get drawn in too close
till they roll that cannon out front.

1391
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,750
All right, ground forces,
lay down some fire!

1392
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,677
Thirteen incoming light craft.

1393
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,751
Shall we hold until we clear them?

1394
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:44,838
No. The Resistance is in that mine.

1395
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,509
Push through.

1396
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:52,873
Fighters, break off!

1397
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,838
Come on! We gotta hold them
till they pull up that cannon!

1398
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:23,316
Rose, you got three right behind you!

1399
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,200
I can't lose 'em!

1400
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,992
Whoo! Yeah!

1401
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:55,996
Whoo! I like this!

1402
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:07,672
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!

1403
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:09,233
All fighters!

1404
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,072
Chewie, peel off from the battle.

1405
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,593
Draw them away from the speeders.

1406
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,038
She drew 'em off! All of 'em!

1407
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,792
Oh, they hate that ship!

1408
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,400
Chewie!

1409
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:14,760
There it is!

1410
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,075
That is a big gun.

1411
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:22,560
Okay, it's heavily armored.

1412
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,671
Our only shot is right down the throat.

1413
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,232
The cannon's opening. This is our chance.

1414
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,680
All firepower on those speeders.

1415
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:38,194
Concentrate all fire on the speeders!

1416
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:46,513
We're taking heavy losses.

1417
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:00,936
They're picking us all off.
We're not gonna make it.

1418
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,678
All right,
making my final approach.

1419
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,239
Target in sight, guns are hot.

1420
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,628
No! Pull off!

1421
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,835
What?

1422
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,576
The cannon is charged!
It's a suicide run!

1423
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:09,953
All craft, pull away!

1424
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:12,190
- No! I'm almost there!
- Retreat, Finn!

1425
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:13,588
That's an order!

1426
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:24,750
Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!

1427
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:26,911
No! I won't let them win!

1428
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,916
No! Finn, listen to Poe!

1429
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,513
We have to retreat!

1430
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,994
The cannon is warming up now.

1431
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:48,496
Copy that. We see it.

1432
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,272
Preparing to fire.

1433
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:33,911
Move! Go, go! Quick!

1434
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,752
Let's go, let's go!

1435
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,354
Rose?

1436
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,115
Rose?

1437
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:51,919
Rose?

1438
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,671
Why would you do that? Huh?

1439
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:56,637
I was almost there.

1440
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:58,919
Why would you stop me?

1441
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,796
I saved you,

1442
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,840
dummy.

1443
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,632
That's how we're gonna win.

1444
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,189
Not fighting what we hate,

1445
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:11,995
saving what we love.

1446
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:32,793
General Hux,

1447
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,518
advance.

1448
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,552
No quarter.

1449
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:39,518
No prisoners.

1450
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:44,511
Our distress signal's been
received at multiple points,

1451
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:46,750
but no response.

1452
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:49,072
They've heard us,

1453
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,556
but no one's coming.

1454
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,070
We fought till the end.

1455
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:05,349
But the galaxy has lost all its hope.

1456
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:08,153
The spark

1457
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,559
is out.

1458
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,718
Luke.

1459
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,754
I know what you're gonna say.

1460
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:52,791
I changed my hair.

1461
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,472
It's nice that way.

1462
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,958
Leia,

1463
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:02,120
I'm sorry.

1464
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,151
I know.

1465
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,555
I know you are.

1466
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:09,316
I'm just glad you're here

1467
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,798
at the end.

1468
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,031
I came to face him, Leia.

1469
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,270
And I can't save him.

1470
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:22,916
I held out hope for so long,

1471
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:28,240
but I know my son is gone.

1472
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:31,839
No one's ever really gone.

1473
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,271
Master Luke.

1474
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,320
Stop!

1475
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:02,475
I want every gun we have
to fire on that man.

1476
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:09,119
Do it.

1477
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:26,875
More!

1478
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,160
More!

1479
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,358
That's enough.

1480
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,995
That's enough!

1481
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,558
Do you think you got him?

1482
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:01,711
Now, if we're ready to get moving,

1483
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:04,075
we can finish this.

1484
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:05,355
Sir?

1485
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,159
Bring me down to him.

1486
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:36,353
Keep the door covered
and don't advance until I say.

1487
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,440
Supreme Leader,

1488
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:39,393
don't get distracted, our goal...

1489
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:43,108
Right away, sir.

1490
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:45,753
Med pack!

1491
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:47,996
I need a med pack!

1492
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,236
She's hurt pretty bad.

1493
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,274
It's Kylo Ren.

1494
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:11,674
Luke's facing him alone.

1495
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,240
Well, we should help him. Let's go.

1496
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,072
No, wait. Wait.

1497
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,395
Did you come back to say you forgive me?

1498
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,277
To save my soul?

1499
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:37,632
No.

1500
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,750
He's doing this for a reason.

1501
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:02,352
He's stalling so we can escape.

1502
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:03,440
Escape?

1503
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,656
He's one man against an army.

1504
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,193
We have to help him,
we have to fight.

1505
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:08,555
No, no. We are the spark
that'll light the fire

1506
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:10,232
that'll burn the First Order down.

1507
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:14,432
Skywalker's doing this
so we can survive.

1508
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:16,136
There's gotta be a way
out of this mine.

1509
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,320
Hell, how did he get in here?

1510
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:21,519
Sir, it is possible that
a natural unmapped opening exists.

1511
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:24,678
But this facility is such
a maze of endless tunnels

1512
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:26,558
that the odds of finding an exit

1513
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:29,313
- are 15,428...
- Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up.

1514
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:30,958
Shut up!

1515
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,878
- To one.
- Listen.

1516
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:38,790
My audio sensors
no longer detect the...

1517
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,029
Exactly.

1518
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:48,639
Where'd the crystal critters go?

1519
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,320
Follow me.

1520
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:01,836
What are you looking at me for?

1521
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,479
Follow him.

1522
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:17,588
If the beacon's right beneath us,
they've got to be somewhere.

1523
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:19,273
Keep scanning for life forms.

1524
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:30,593
This way.

1525
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,798
I see them! Chewie, there!

1526
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:53,358
No. No, no, no.

1527
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:57,760
No!

1528
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,831
Lifting rocks.

1529
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:54,434
I failed you, Ben.

1530
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,635
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sure you are!

1531
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,870
The Resistance is dead.

1532
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:02,598
The war is over.

1533
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,791
And when I kill you,

1534
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:07,394
I will have killed the last Jedi.

1535
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:08,675
Amazing.

1536
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:12,994
Every word of what you just said
was wrong.

1537
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,477
The Rebellion is reborn today.

1538
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:22,671
The war

1539
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,512
is just beginning.

1540
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:29,599
And I will not be the last Jedi.

1541
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,436
I'll destroy her,

1542
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:13,636
and you,

1543
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:15,438
and all of it.

1544
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:20,280
No.

1545
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:24,631
Strike me down in anger
and I'll always be with you.

1546
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,350
Just like your father.

1547
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:19,800
No.

1548
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:26,236
See you around, kid.

1549
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,319
No!

1550
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:20,796
C'ai!

1551
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:22,836
Such a friend.

1552
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:24,918
Chewie!

1553
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:27,992
It looks good.

1554
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:29,589
That was crazy, man.

1555
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:32,519
- Hi.
- Hi.

1556
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,155
I'm Poe.

1557
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Rey.

1558
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,395
I know.

1559
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:51,776
When we get to the Outer Rim,
I have a contact there.

1560
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:53,120
Quite definitely possible.

1561
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,999
Luke is gone.

1562
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:07,279
I felt it.

1563
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:09,711
But it wasn't sadness or pain.

1564
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,309
It was peace and purpose.

1565
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:15,599
I felt it, too.

1566
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:21,192
How do we build a Rebellion from this?

1567
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:28,359
We have everything we need.

1568
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,797
Luke Skywalker,

1569
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:51,757
Jedi Master.
