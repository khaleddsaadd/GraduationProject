Bye.

187
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:26,085
Well, sir,
expect the lady and myself

188
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:29,054
to darken your door
once the nose bag is empty.

189
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:31,824
And, Baby, you did good, kid.

190
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:34,827
Do me a favor.
Next time Doc calls,

191
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,929
don't pick up.

192
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,597
Don't listen to him.

193
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:49,208
Now, I get absolutely no pleasure
in taking candy from Baby,

194
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:52,945
but we're fast approaching
the day when you...

195
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,281
Will be all paid up.

196
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:00,585
One more job and I'm done?

197
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,955
One more job and
we're straight.

198
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:04,957
Sound good?

199
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,892
Oh...

200
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:10,830
I was gonna wait until we were
square, but what the hell.

201
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:12,297
These are for you.

202
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,400
Now give me your burner.

203
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:21,273
I'm gonna need you behind
the wheel again real soon.

204
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,886
You call, I'm there.

205
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:33,986
Here's what we know.

206
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:35,530
Two men and a woman
came into the bank branch

207
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:38,057
clad in black
business clothing,

208
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,625
trench coats,
bandanas and sunglasses.

209
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:43,562
They pulled guns and ordered
everybody to the floor,

210
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:45,797
and then cleaned out
the registers.

211
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:49,534
And hear this, they even swiped
jewelry from some of the customers.

212
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,270
You awake?

213
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:53,314
They ran out of the bank
to a waiting getaway car.

214
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:56,008
A driver was there to take them away.
It was a red...

215
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:58,343
You hungry?

216
00:13:58,477 --> 00:13:59,544
Always.

217
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:00,946
You got it.

218
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:19,264
Spread to the edges!

219
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:25,470
...is a young Caucasian male.

220
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:27,206
His identity
remains as yet unknown,

221
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:29,208
and police are
appealing to anyone

222
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:32,044
who might recognize him
to come forward.

223
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:34,179
The search for
the suspect is ongoing.

224
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:35,847
Police pursued
the getaway vehicle

225
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:39,018
across downtown Atlanta
and I-85 by helicopter.

226
00:14:45,257 --> 00:14:47,759
Where is that cash from?

227
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,494
Work.

228
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,329
One more job.

229
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,865
Then I'm done.

230
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,868
You don't

231
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:58,203
belong

232
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:00,772
in that world.

233
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:02,946
Sorry, couldn't hear you.
I have a banana in my ear.

234
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:07,112

bloodied but unrelenting.

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,407

So, what is it you do?

287
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,361
I'm a driver.

I hope not.

00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:52,836

00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:58,410
So, when was the last time
you hit the road just for fun?

297
00:18:58,543 --> 00:18:59,844
Yesterday.

298
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:01,413
Oh, then I'm jealous.

Over here is Eddie No Nose,
formerly Eddie The Nose.

00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:14,045
Why, what happened?

342
00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:15,480

00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,050
And right here is JD.

345
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:20,952
He put the "Asian"
in home invasion.

346
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:23,121
And over there is
the one and the only Bats.

347
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:24,723
No need for intros, Doc.

348
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:27,392

This the one you say listens
to the music all the time?

351
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,968
The driver's supposed
to be the eyes and the ears,

352
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,137
not just the eyes.

353
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,640
Why does he listen to music
all the time, Doc?

354
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:43,518
- He's got mental problems?
- No, no, no, no.

355
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:46,244
I'm the one got the mental
problems in the crew.

356

Position taken.

357
00:21:47,612 --> 00:21:48,713
He's got tinnitus.

358
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:50,148
Tinna-what?

359
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,150
He had an accident
when he was a kid.

360
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,723
He's still got a hum in the drum.
Plays music to drown it out.

361
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,623
Yeah, but you feel me.

362
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:03,362
Hat?

363
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:04,495
Huh?

364
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:06,030
Your tattoo says, "Hat."

365
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:08,633
Yeah. It used to say "Hate."

366
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:12,303
But to increase my chances of
employment, I got the "E" removed.

367
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:13,805
How's that
working out for you?

368
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:16,040
Who doesn't like hats?

369
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:17,376
So, Doc,

370
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,043
how many jobs
you done with the kid?

371
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:20,712
If you can't take
my word for him,

372
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:23,214
then get back in
that fucking elevator.

373
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:25,617
You never heard of
the Spirit of 85?

374
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,953
The joyrider?
Yeah.

375
00:22:29,087 --> 00:22:32,223
The ghost that baited
cops doing 130 on 85.

376
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:34,626
Headlights off,
brake lights disconnected.

377
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:37,095
He drove 'em around in circles
on Spaghetti Junction.

378
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:39,798
Left 'em in the dust every time.
That was our boy there.

379
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:41,241
Wasn't that, like, 10 years ago?
Yeah.

380
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:42,701
Well, like I said,
that was our boy.

381
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,311
He's been boosting cars
since he was old enough

382
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:45,804
to see over the dash.

383
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:47,648
He stole my Mercedes.
Had a lot of merch in it.

384
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:49,550
I watched him do it, too.
I didn't stop him, though,

385
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:51,943
'cause I was just blinded
by the balls on that kid.

386
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:53,845
'Course he didn't know
who I was,

387
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:56,056
or the worth of the junk in
the trunk once he dumped it,

388
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,150
but once I tracked him down,
I made sure to tell him who I was,

389
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:01,953
what I was capable of,
and how much he owed me.

390
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:03,688
And since he's
been paying me back,

391
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:05,382
he's also shown me
what he's capable of.

392
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,758
Wow.

393
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:08,369
I just drew a whole
goddamn map in chalk

394
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:09,994
while we've been
standing here squawking.

395
00:23:10,128 --> 00:23:12,931
That's pretty
fucking impressive, right?

396
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:16,067
Shop, let's talk it.
Baby, you with us?

397
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:58,743
Bank robbers. Whatever.

398
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:01,613
It's got to be ready for
an 8:30 start in the a.m.

399
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:02,747
Questions?

400
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:06,451
I got a question, Doc.

401
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:09,488
Why would I believe Phones over
here heard a goddamn word you said?

402
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:12,423
You laid down your whole play.
He ain't even listening.

403
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,093
Baby?

404
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,467
The target is an armored truck

405
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:23,878
at Perimeter Trust in Dunwoody,
10:00 a.m. sharp.

406
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,336
We have
the details of the route

407
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,506
because someone at the depot
has a nasal problem.

408
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,249
The bank itself is right
near the Buford Highway,

409
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,451
so we should be able
to hit the ramp

410
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:31,619
within 60 seconds
of getting out.

411
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:33,177
We also have a diversion crew.

412
00:24:33,311 --> 00:24:35,191
They're gonna blow up
a bread truck a ways away,

413
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:37,081
keep the fuzz busy.

414
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:39,217
The dress code is the Michael
Myers Halloween mask,

415
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,153
but don't all buy your masks at the
same time. It looks suspicious.

416
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:44,055
The switch car is ready,

417
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:45,399
but you want me to hit the
long-stay parking structure

418
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:46,891
at Hartsfield-Jackson

419
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:48,703
to get a heist vehicle
that stays colder longer.

420
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:50,562
Boost a commuter car,
a family car,

421
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:52,897
something that blends in well
with morning traffic.

422
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:56,134
Something on the heavy side in case
we need to ram the cops off the road.

423
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:59,170
A Escalade, Yukon,
Avalanche, whatever.

424
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:02,473
It needs to be ready
for an 8:30 start in the a.m.

425
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,476
Questions?

426
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,811
Well, ain't y'all cute.

427
00:25:06,945 --> 00:25:08,647
That's my Baby.

428
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,148
Fuck your Baby.

429
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:35,874
What's in there
is ours.

430
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,242
It belongs to us.

431
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:41,012
They took our money,
our hard-earned paper.

432
00:25:41,145 --> 00:25:42,947
They snuck in when we
were asleep last night

433
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:45,950
and took the pants off the
chair and emptied our wallets.

434
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,787
They got what's
rightfully ours.

435
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:51,623
Let's go get it back,

436
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:53,057

437

What the fuck is this mask?

438
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,864
Austin Powers.

439
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:01,900
Doc said Michael Myers!

440
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,334
This is Mike Myers!

441
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:04,707

the Halloween mask.

The girl.

722
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:56,453
His name,
Malik Kelly, a local veteran.

723
00:41:56,587 --> 00:42:00,357
You saw what these folks were doing.
You took action. Why?

724
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,526
I'm done.

725
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,838
I saw these guys go marching
in the bank with Halloween masks,

726
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:06,063
weapons drawn.

727
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:07,330
They were attacking...

728
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:08,532
Is this the place?

729
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,204

Celebrating you getting

00:42:21,478 --> 00:42:23,046
a real job.

734
00:42:24,582 --> 00:42:26,216
What kind of job?

735
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:27,350
Wouldn't it be good

736
00:42:27,484 --> 00:42:30,854
to bring joy to people

737
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:34,224

Whoa.

741
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:05,589
That was fast.

742
00:43:05,723 --> 00:43:06,890
I know.

743
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:09,092
Pizza!

744
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:21,004
Look...

745
00:43:21,138 --> 00:43:23,206
You only have to
wash your hands once

746
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,008
after counting that.

747
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:27,044

748
00:43:27,177 --> 00:43:28,445

00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,422

A gentleman?

00:44:27,971 --> 00:44:29,740
Who is that?

766
00:44:30,908 --> 00:44:32,575
It's my old boss.

767
00:44:33,877 --> 00:44:35,412
Uh...

768
00:44:35,545 --> 00:44:37,247
Excuse me one second.

769
00:44:39,149 --> 00:44:41,309
- Here you are, madam.
- Thank you very much.

770
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:43,120
Have a good night.

771
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:47,157
Good meal, Baby?

772
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,492
That foie gras terrine
is something, huh?

773
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,261
Yeah.

774
00:44:51,394 --> 00:44:53,163
You don't look
happy to see me. Why?

775
00:44:53,296 --> 00:44:55,833
I said we were straight,
but did you think we were done?

776
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:57,534
That that was it?

777
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,703
Uh, I guess I did.

778
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:02,339
Well, I could give you the
good news and the bad news,

779
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:04,241
except there is no bad news.

780
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:06,744
The good news is you're about
to make a lot of money.

781
00:45:06,877 --> 00:45:10,247
And the good news is you're
about to make a lot of money.

782
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,982
I got... I got a job, Doc.

783
00:45:12,115 --> 00:45:14,852
Yeah, but why slave away
delivering GoodFellas pizzas

784
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:17,087
just to afford
a night out here,

785
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,357
when you could make all that
dough with a great fella? Me.

786
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,927
And then take your gal here for fucking
dinner every night of the week?

787
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:26,663
You paid off your debt.
Now it's time to profit.

788
00:45:26,797 --> 00:45:28,465
This is the fun bit, Baby.

789
00:45:28,598 --> 00:45:30,744
By the time this job is over,
you'll be rolling in money,

790
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:35,372
buying Maseratis and feeding
your gal catfish dipped in gold.

791
00:45:35,505 --> 00:45:36,706
So, what do you say?
You in?

792
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,709
Am I in?

793
00:45:39,843 --> 00:45:41,821
No, don't answer my question
with another question.

794
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:44,247
You give me one of
two replies. Yes or no.

795
00:45:46,116 --> 00:45:48,886
No, Doc.

796
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:52,522
You know I never do a job with the
exact same crew twice, right?

797
00:45:52,655 --> 00:45:54,024
Yes.
And you also know

798
00:45:54,157 --> 00:45:56,526
you've been my driver
for every job since we met.

799
00:45:57,427 --> 00:45:58,762
Yes.

800
00:46:00,363 --> 00:46:04,134
So, I'm of the thinking
that you are my lucky charm

801
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:07,871
and that I'm not doing
this job without you.

802
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:09,415
Now, I don't think I need
to give you the speech

803
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:10,908
about what happens
when you say no,

804
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:12,852
how I could break your legs
and kill everyone you love,

805
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:14,476
because you already
know that, don't you?

806
00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:17,614
Yeah.

807
00:46:17,747 --> 00:46:19,149
So, what's it gonna be,

808
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:21,284
behind the wheel
or in a wheelchair?

809
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:23,286
The first one.

810
00:46:25,755 --> 00:46:26,995
I'll pick you up
in the morning.

811
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:29,927
Don't stay out
too late, now.

812
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,294
Oh.

813
00:46:31,428 --> 00:46:35,032
And your, uh, waitress
girlfriend, she's cute.

814
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:37,200
Let's keep it that way.

815
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,136
Good night, sir.

816
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:46,709
Well, that was some
pretty fine winin' and dinin'.

817
00:46:46,844 --> 00:46:49,980
Must have friends in high
places to get a table there.

818
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:51,882
Oh, I don't know
about that.

819
00:46:54,351 --> 00:46:56,319
Is everything okay, Baby?

820
00:46:59,756 --> 00:47:01,424
It will be.

821
00:47:01,558 --> 00:47:05,362
You want to talk about it?
I make a mean cup of coffee.

822
00:47:05,495 --> 00:47:08,832
I mean, I... I don't.
I make terrible coffee.

823
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,801
I want to, but I...

824
00:47:11,935 --> 00:47:13,436
I can't right now.

825
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,939
You know, you...

826
00:47:16,073 --> 00:47:18,876
You don't have
to worry about me.

827
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:20,477
You can tell me anything.

828
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:21,879
I'm not worried about you.

829
00:47:22,012 --> 00:47:24,681
I mean, I...

830
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:28,785
You're the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

831
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:34,257
And I just worry that
I'm not good enough for you.

832
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:38,028
Oh, well, don't.

833
00:47:40,597 --> 00:47:44,667
I can see you're kind
and you're different.

834
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:48,972
And I'm here for you
when you're ready.

835
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:02,652
What are you doing tomorrow?

836
00:48:05,322 --> 00:48:06,756
Uh, you tell me.

837
00:48:29,812 --> 00:48:31,414
Good morning.

838
00:48:33,883 --> 00:48:36,053
These places never
get rolled.

839
00:48:36,186 --> 00:48:38,855
People don't realize that there's
gold in them there hills.

840
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:41,024
And those that do,
don't have the stones

841
00:48:41,158 --> 00:48:43,160
to pull off a job so
public in the hub of it.

842
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:45,104
This place'll be ripe
around this time tomorrow,

843
00:48:45,128 --> 00:48:47,164
but I need you to do
something for me today.

844
00:48:47,297 --> 00:48:49,266
I can't be seen in there,
but you can.

845
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:50,900
So go inside.

846
00:48:51,034 --> 00:48:53,170
Take note of the number
of cameras and positions,

847
00:48:53,303 --> 00:48:55,005
the number of registers open,

848
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:57,540
the number of employees
and the number of customers.

849
00:48:57,674 --> 00:48:59,342
Is there a guard?
Is he armed?

850
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:01,344
Do they have bandit glass?

851
00:49:01,478 --> 00:49:03,546
And get in line,
buy some stamps.

852
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,984
Take your buds out,
pull your shades off.

853
00:49:07,117 --> 00:49:10,420
Oh, and, uh, take the nephew.
Less suspicious.

854
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:16,269
The United States Postal Service.

855
00:49:16,293 --> 00:49:19,562
We're here, working for you,
seven days a week.

856
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:22,332
We do a lot more
than just stamps these days.

857
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:25,802
You'd be surprised at
what we have to offer.

858
00:49:25,935 --> 00:49:28,081
Yeah, Jack,
all looks fine back here. Over.

859
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,056
No bandit glass,
one armed guard,

860
00:49:46,189 --> 00:49:49,426
10 cameras,
eight registers, two open,

861
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,063
11 customers and
four employees.

862
00:49:53,196 --> 00:49:54,564
Thank you.

863
00:49:57,934 --> 00:49:59,336
Uh...

864
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:00,903
Uh, stamps.

865
00:50:02,705 --> 00:50:04,107
That your boy?

866
00:50:04,707 --> 00:50:06,209
Sure.

867
00:50:06,343 --> 00:50:07,510
Yeah, he sure is.

868
00:50:07,644 --> 00:50:08,645
How old is he?

869
00:50:10,347 --> 00:50:12,515
Four.
Eight.

870
00:50:12,649 --> 00:50:14,951
They grow up so
freaking fast, don't they?

871
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,488
Does he have a name?

872
00:50:19,856 --> 00:50:21,291
You have a name, don't you?

873
00:50:21,424 --> 00:50:22,825
Samm.

874
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:25,495
Well, Samm, I got a mint
with your name on it.

875
00:50:25,628 --> 00:50:28,165
You have a mint
that says "Samm"?

876
00:50:28,298 --> 00:50:29,566
Aw.

877
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:31,501
Sweet.

878
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:33,070
Are you here tomorrow?

879
00:50:33,203 --> 00:50:35,505
Sure am. Working 9:00
to 5:00, just like Dolly.

880
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:39,376
Oh, Dolly Parton. Yeah.

881
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:41,511
I like her.
Mmm, who doesn't?

882
00:50:41,644 --> 00:50:43,613
"Everybody wants happiness,
nobody wants pain.

883
00:50:43,746 --> 00:50:46,449
"But you can't have a rainbow
without a little rain."

884
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:47,717
Wise lady.

885
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:51,288
Yeah, she sure is.
Hmm.

886
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:52,421
Bye.

887
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:02,965
Hit me.

888
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:07,337
No bandit glass,
one armed guard,

889
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,440
10 cameras,
eight registers, three open.

890
00:51:11,574 --> 00:51:14,177
And, uh, 11 customers.

891
00:51:18,181 --> 00:51:19,749
And, uh, four employees.

892
00:51:19,882 --> 00:51:21,084
Anything else?

893
00:51:22,152 --> 00:51:23,620
The teller seemed nice.

894
00:51:23,753 --> 00:51:25,054
She gave me a mint.

895
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:26,889
Did she?
Yeah.

896
00:51:27,023 --> 00:51:29,426
You probably wouldn't even
need to use a gun with her.

897
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:32,695
Just say "boo," and she'll
give you the big bills first.

898
00:51:34,097 --> 00:51:35,532
Chip's off the old block.

899
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:46,109
What floor are you on?

900
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,011
Third.

901
00:51:49,146 --> 00:51:51,514
Those stairs must be a
real bitch for Joe, huh?

902
00:51:53,015 --> 00:51:55,051
It's my business
to know everything.

903
00:51:55,185 --> 00:51:57,187
So, are they a bitch?

904
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,755
There's an elevator.

905
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,759
Ooh, fancy.

906
00:52:05,328 --> 00:52:06,528
So, am I gonna
see you tonight?

907
00:52:07,897 --> 00:52:09,732
Yes, you will.

908
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:11,610
You're not just saying what you
think I want to hear, right?

909
00:52:11,634 --> 00:52:14,137
You consider me a friend,
don't you?

910
00:52:15,438 --> 00:52:16,839
You and I are a team.

911
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:19,242
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

912
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,444
Good to know.

913
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:24,581
You'll be out of
this shithole soon.

914
00:52:24,714 --> 00:52:26,749
You're going up in the world!

915
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:38,161
Bo's Diner,
what'll you have?

916
00:52:38,295 --> 00:52:39,829
Is Debora there?

917
00:52:39,962 --> 00:52:41,331
Debbie, phone.

918
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:43,400
Keep it short.

919
00:52:44,801 --> 00:52:46,669
Hello?
It's Baby.

920
00:52:46,803 --> 00:52:49,672
Hey. To what do
I owe this honor?

921
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:53,176
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

922
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,245
Am I still seeing you later?

923
00:52:55,378 --> 00:52:57,414
I have to drive again.

924
00:52:57,547 --> 00:53:00,983
Oh, okay. Thought
y'all were done with that.

925
00:53:01,117 --> 00:53:05,255
So did I.
It's not what I want.

926
00:53:05,388 --> 00:53:07,290
And what do you want, Baby?

927
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:11,594
I want us to head west on 20,

928
00:53:11,728 --> 00:53:14,364
in a car we can't afford,

929
00:53:14,497 --> 00:53:16,399
with a plan we don't have.

930
00:53:18,134 --> 00:53:20,002
Keep driving and never stop.

931
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,339
Are you serious?

932
00:53:22,472 --> 00:53:23,840
I am, Debora.

933
00:53:25,308 --> 00:53:27,244
You in?

934
00:53:27,377 --> 00:53:28,678
I'm in, Baby.

935
00:53:29,512 --> 00:53:30,680
See you soon.

936
00:53:40,957 --> 00:53:42,525
♪ Holy calamity,
scream insanity

937
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:44,503
♪ All you ever gonna be's
another great fan of me

938

00:53:49,098 --> 00:53:50,166
There he is.

942
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:53,035
Hey, Baby.
Hey, Baby.

943
00:53:53,169 --> 00:53:54,971
Hear-No-Evil's back, huh?

944
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:57,307
Have you seen this kid move?
Yeah, I've seen him.

945
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,175
Think Doc likes
having him around

946
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:01,086
because he can park in the
disabled spots by the bank.

947
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,179
- Disabled spot?
- Yeah.

948
00:54:03,313 --> 00:54:05,524
He got some shit wrong with his ears.
Tinnitus or something.

949
00:54:05,548 --> 00:54:08,184
Anyway, he gotta listen
to music 24 hours a day

950
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:09,986
to drown out
the whining in his ears.

951
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:11,488
Oh, shit!

952
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:13,523
You know who else has
the exact same thing

953
00:54:13,656 --> 00:54:16,058
and does that
exact same thing?

954
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:17,427
Barbra Streisand.

955
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,071
Darling, do I look like
I know a fucking thing

956
00:54:19,095 --> 00:54:20,863
about Barbra
fucking Streisand?

957
00:54:20,997 --> 00:54:23,466
Hey! Watch your mouth.
That's my lady you're talking to.

958
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,634
Yeah.

959
00:54:26,068 --> 00:54:27,437
Watch your mouth.

960
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:29,272
I'll watch what
I want to watch.

961
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:36,413
Is that true?

962
00:54:36,546 --> 00:54:38,090
Is that why you have music
in your head all the time?

963
00:54:38,114 --> 00:54:39,148
Drown out the noise?

964
00:54:39,282 --> 00:54:40,283
Yeah.

965
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:41,818
It keeps me moving.

966
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:44,821
It's an escape. I get it.

967
00:54:44,954 --> 00:54:47,857
Hey, Buddy, you seen a violin?
I had a violin here.

968
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,559
Shut up.

969
00:54:51,828 --> 00:54:53,763
I used to fool around with
cars when I was a kid.

970
00:54:53,896 --> 00:54:56,866
Drive around all night like a speed
freak listening to the radio.

971
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:59,936
I used to have
my special tape

972
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:02,472
that had my killer
track on it. Get me flying.

973
00:55:02,605 --> 00:55:03,873
You got one of those?

974
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:05,241
Sure.

975
00:55:06,376 --> 00:55:07,777
Well, what is it?

976
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,379
Brighton Rock.
What?

977
00:55:09,512 --> 00:55:10,647
Queen?

978
00:55:11,414 --> 00:55:13,115
Yeah.

979
00:55:13,249 --> 00:55:14,817
It's got that
crazy big guitar solo.

980
00:55:14,951 --> 00:55:16,118
Yeah, I know that song.

981
00:55:16,252 --> 00:55:17,796
My brother used to
play Sheer Heart Attack

982
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,356
right through the wall.

983
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:20,990
You got it on here?

984
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:23,326
Uh, I got it on this one.

985
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,828
Play it.
Let's hear that killer track.

986
00:55:35,271 --> 00:55:37,106
Yeah.

987
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,640
What you ladies
listening to?

988
00:55:45,682 --> 00:55:47,617
Queen.
Queen!

989
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,270
Queen? Streisand, now Queen.
What the fuck? What y'all gonna do?

990
00:55:50,387 --> 00:55:52,365
Y'all gonna belt out show
tunes on the way to the job?

991
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:54,256
You don't need
a score for a score.

992
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:56,192
You just...

993
00:55:56,325 --> 00:56:00,096
Put your fucking foot on the
gas and drive the goddamn car.

994
00:56:00,229 --> 00:56:01,798
That's all
the music you need, folks.

995
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:04,200
Come on, now.

996
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:07,770
You never been a wheelman?
You never had a lucky song?

997
00:56:07,904 --> 00:56:11,474
Well, a cigarette song.
Apres-heist, glass of scotch.

998
00:56:11,608 --> 00:56:12,642
Absolutely.

999
00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:15,177
But not before a job.

1000
00:56:15,311 --> 00:56:18,548
I got enough demons right here
playing music all the time.

1001
00:56:18,681 --> 00:56:20,383
Yeah, well, that I believe.

1002
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:22,294
Had a buddy once walk away from a job.
You know why?

1003
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:24,687
Because something was playing
on the radio he didn't like.

1004
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:27,590
We about to go in, he won't
get out the fucking car. Why?

1005
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:29,524
'Cause Knock, Knock,
Knockin' on Heaven's Door

1006
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:33,095
is playing on the FM.
He called it a hex song.

1007
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:35,331
That, End of the Road
by Boyz II Men,

1008
00:56:35,465 --> 00:56:36,833
Hotel California
by the Eagles.

1009
00:56:36,966 --> 00:56:38,868
He called 'em all hex songs.

1010
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:41,571
Then come talking about some crazy
shit like we all gonna die.

1011
00:56:41,704 --> 00:56:42,939
So what?
You bail on the job?

1012
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:44,407
Fuck no,
I didn't bail on the job.

1013
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:46,075
I went and got that money.

1014
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:48,277
And we didn't die, either.

1015
00:56:48,411 --> 00:56:50,413
Now, he bought it
a little later,

1016
00:56:50,547 --> 00:56:52,582
but it had nothing
to do with the heist.

1017
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:54,984
Do all your stories end up
with somebody dying?

1018
00:56:56,786 --> 00:56:58,888
I guess you just
got to find out, huh?

1019
00:57:01,357 --> 00:57:03,493
I need four pairs of eyes
and three sets of ears.

1020
00:57:03,626 --> 00:57:05,027
Gather round.

1021
00:57:16,038 --> 00:57:18,040
The postal service is dying.

1022
00:57:18,174 --> 00:57:20,276
People don't care
about their mail anymore.

1023
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:23,913
Lucky for us,
their loss is our gain.

1024
00:57:25,214 --> 00:57:26,616
Money orders.

1025
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:29,486
For I happen to know a guy
who has a machine

1026
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:32,489
that can turn
blank ones into green.

1027
00:57:32,622 --> 00:57:35,758
Each box contains
250 slips per box,

1028
00:57:35,892 --> 00:57:37,827
each slip worth
up to a grand.

1029
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,396
That's quarter
a mil per box.

1030
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:42,398
Dot, dot, dot.
You do the math.

1031
00:57:42,532 --> 00:57:44,333
Darling goes in the front.

1032
00:57:44,467 --> 00:57:47,604
Buddy takes a five-alligator
count and follows her inside.

1033
00:57:47,737 --> 00:57:52,775
You put on these privacy glasses
to blind the CCTV camera.

1034
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:54,544
Another five-alligator count.

1035
00:57:54,677 --> 00:57:56,979
Darling gets in line,
Buddy takes her hostage,

1036
00:57:57,113 --> 00:57:58,214
shotgun to her head.

1037
00:57:58,347 --> 00:58:00,416
That gets you guys
in the back office.

1038
00:58:01,584 --> 00:58:03,953
We role-play that a lot.

1039
00:58:04,086 --> 00:58:05,221
Uh-huh.

1040
00:58:05,354 --> 00:58:07,490
Baby drives Bats
around the loading dock.

1041
00:58:07,624 --> 00:58:11,561
Bats uses this security card supplied
by an insider with a nasal problem

1042
00:58:11,694 --> 00:58:13,730
to get in the staff entrance
and cover the rear.

1043
00:58:13,863 --> 00:58:16,298
You guys grab all the boxes
and then sneak out the back

1044
00:58:16,432 --> 00:58:18,100
to Baby and the waiting car.

1045
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:23,139
Did you get all that, Baby?

1046
00:58:23,272 --> 00:58:24,473
Yeah.

1047
00:58:24,607 --> 00:58:26,676
Okay, one more thing.

1048
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:30,547
We need some fresh hardware,
not traceable to us or any previous jobs.

1049
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,883
Now, I've got some contacts who
can get us some clean firepower,

1050
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:35,518
so the pickup is tonight.

1051
00:58:35,652 --> 00:58:37,787
But after the pickup,
you come straight back here.

1052
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,857
You all have an early start in the morning,
and there's eyes everywhere.

1053
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:43,526
So, you're staying
the night here.

1054
00:58:44,927 --> 00:58:47,029
Oh, we in bed together now.

1061
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:20,830
Want some gum?
Want some gum, Buddy?

1062
00:59:20,963 --> 00:59:22,531
Yeah, I'll take some gum.

1063
00:59:25,768 --> 00:59:28,537
Tell me what we're
gonna do with all that money.

1064
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:31,574
We're gonna go to Vegas.
We'll put it all on red.

1065
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:33,676
We'll get married again.
It'll be real romantic.

1066
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:36,345
Mmm.

1067
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:39,215
You know what was real,
real romantic?

1068
00:59:39,348 --> 00:59:41,784
What was real,
real romantic?

1069
00:59:41,918 --> 00:59:43,720
When you stabbed that guy.

1070
00:59:43,853 --> 00:59:45,622
Which guy?

1071
00:59:45,755 --> 00:59:47,633
The guy that robbed you,
the guy that called you a whore,

1072
00:59:47,657 --> 00:59:49,291
or the guy that
looked at you funny?

1073
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:50,593
The last one.

1074
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:53,229
Yeah. I do remember that.

1075
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:55,798
Bats just looked at me funny.

1076
00:59:58,534 --> 01:00:01,003
You want me to kill Bats?

1077
01:00:01,137 --> 01:00:03,405
Not before the job, silly.
Hmm?

1078
01:00:05,507 --> 01:00:07,587
You think we should talk
about this in front of Baby?

1079
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:11,013
He won't say a thing.
Will you, Baby? Hmm?

1080
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:16,018
Jesus Christ.

1081
01:00:16,152 --> 01:00:17,353
What,
did you steal all this?

1082
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:19,055
You said
you wanted some gum.

1083
01:00:19,188 --> 01:00:21,624
Fuck I'm supposed to do, pay for it?
Let's go.

1084
01:00:23,425 --> 01:00:24,460
Let's go.

1085
01:00:26,763 --> 01:00:28,765
♪ I can't around it, no

1086
01:00:28,898 --> 01:00:30,667
♪ Nowhere to run

1087
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,502
♪ Nowhere to hide
from you, baby... ♪

1088
01:00:33,636 --> 01:00:35,504
Looks like
the farmers' market is open.

1089
01:00:35,638 --> 01:00:37,173
Farmers' market?

1090
01:00:37,306 --> 01:00:39,809
Yeah. Doc says
we got to go see The Butcher.

1091
01:01:16,713 --> 01:01:18,815
Come on,
you're going in with us.

1092
01:01:18,948 --> 01:01:20,783
We might not be
leaving in this.

1093
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:30,092
And, uh, find
something funky on there.

1094
01:01:30,226 --> 01:01:32,494
Just in case we got
to rip this joint up.

1095
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:36,365
Take this.

1096
01:01:36,498 --> 01:01:38,067
Act like you
know how to use it.

1097
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,668
Why would he need it?

1098
01:01:39,802 --> 01:01:41,637
Got to swagger in
like you got one,

1099
01:01:41,771 --> 01:01:43,572
so we don't all look
like a bunch of pussies.

1100
01:01:43,706 --> 01:01:45,641
Darling excluded.

1101
01:01:47,977 --> 01:01:50,479
What's with the earbuds?
Recording this or something?

1102
01:01:50,612 --> 01:01:51,914
It's just his music.

1103
01:01:52,048 --> 01:01:53,728
Yeah, he's loony.
He's just like his tunes.

1104
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,852
What's he listening to?

1105
01:01:55,985 --> 01:01:57,586
How the fuck I know?

1106
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,155
Let me check.

1107
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:04,126
Tequila!

1108
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,795
Which reminds me,

1109
01:02:05,928 --> 01:02:08,130
why'd the Mexican dude
throw his wife off the cliff?

1110
01:02:08,264 --> 01:02:10,499
Ah! Ruined it.
Didn't I ruin it?

1111
01:02:11,433 --> 01:02:12,902
We met before, right?

1112
01:02:13,035 --> 01:02:14,804
I don't know.
You still alive, right?

1113
01:02:14,937 --> 01:02:15,937
Uh-huh.

1114
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:17,639
Then I guess
we ain't never met.

1115
01:02:19,008 --> 01:02:20,142
Shut the fuck up!

1116
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:22,578
I've got it.
I've got it.

1117
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:26,215
Voila!

1118
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:29,485
Welcome to la charcuterie.

1119
01:02:31,287 --> 01:02:33,489
Tonight, gentlemen, madame,

1120
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:35,691
we have only
the finest cuts of pork,

1121
01:02:35,825 --> 01:02:38,360
direct from
the local smokehouse.

1122
01:02:38,494 --> 01:02:40,462
You're all experienced
butchers yourself.

1123
01:02:40,596 --> 01:02:43,132
I assume you are aware that
the humble pig can be cooked

1124
01:02:43,265 --> 01:02:46,568
from nose to tail,
everything but the squeal.

1125
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:48,905
I can offer you nine cuts

1126
01:02:49,038 --> 01:02:51,440
at the best prices
in all of Christendom.

1127
01:02:51,573 --> 01:02:53,475
So let's dive in
head-first.

1128
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:57,980
From the jowl comes the godsent
Roman bacon that is guanciale.

1129
01:02:58,114 --> 01:03:00,582
From the shoulder
of the hog comes

1130
01:03:00,716 --> 01:03:03,452
the Boston butt,
a tough but tasty cut.

1131
01:03:03,585 --> 01:03:04,887
The picnic shoulder
is a favorite

1132
01:03:05,021 --> 01:03:08,624
of those who enjoy
the smoking of pigs.

1133
01:03:08,757 --> 01:03:11,027
The center-cut loin,
the double-cut pork chops,

1134
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,461
baby back ribs,

1135
01:03:12,594 --> 01:03:15,431
and the Serrano ham,
on the back leg, of course.

1136
01:03:15,564 --> 01:03:16,933
All delicious.

1137
01:03:17,066 --> 01:03:18,767
Delicious.

1138
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:22,038
And, of course, we have a
fine selection of sausages.

1139
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:23,305
Well, I'm hungry.

1140
01:03:23,439 --> 01:03:24,907
Fantastique.

1141
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:26,608
And your choice is...

1142
01:03:26,742 --> 01:03:29,778
Well, I'm gonna go
with the picnic shoulder,

1143
01:03:29,912 --> 01:03:31,613
'cause, um, I just
love smoking pigs.

1144
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:06,182
Done deal.

1145
01:04:08,384 --> 01:04:10,152
Dumb son of a bitch.

1146
01:04:10,286 --> 01:04:11,587
Whoa! Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1147
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,000
Fuck, Bats!
You got my wife shot!

1148
01:04:13,089 --> 01:04:14,156
I don't like that!

1149
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,292
Relax, Buddy.
You handled it!

1150
01:04:16,425 --> 01:04:18,236
What the fuck, you piece of shit?
You shot the gunsmiths.

1151
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,661
Weren't they
fucking Doc's contacts?

1152
01:04:19,795 --> 01:04:21,130
They were Doc's contacts!

1153
01:04:21,263 --> 01:04:22,464
Guess what, they was pigs.

1154
01:04:22,598 --> 01:04:24,100
Look at the box.
It says "APD."

1155
01:04:24,233 --> 01:04:25,968
I clocked that
tall strip of bacon

1156
01:04:26,102 --> 01:04:28,504
with that fake-ass Louis
Vuitton hat right off the bat.

1157
01:04:28,637 --> 01:04:30,606
He busted me in '98.

1158
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:33,118
Now, I don't know about you
lovebirds fucking without a condom,

1159
01:04:33,142 --> 01:04:34,887
but when somebody getting
ready to barbecue me,

1160
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:36,031
I go full-metal
batshit on...

1161
01:04:36,078 --> 01:04:37,513
- Shit!
- Get him!

1162
01:04:37,646 --> 01:04:38,991
Baby, don't let him get away!
Get him! Get him!

1163
01:04:39,015 --> 01:04:40,749
Do something!
Get him!

1164
01:04:40,883 --> 01:04:41,984

Uh, yeah, I think it'll be,
uh, Coke all around, right?

So let me get three
Cokes and one Coca.

1214
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,522
Four Cokes?
Yeah.

1215
01:07:36,592 --> 01:07:38,227
Look, here's the deal.

1216
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,229
You rob to
support a drug habit.

1217
01:07:40,362 --> 01:07:42,198
I do drugs to
support a robbery habit.

1218
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:44,300
That's clever.
That's my job, see.

1219
01:07:44,433 --> 01:07:46,102
It's you two
who's on vacation.

1220
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:48,370
So you doubt
our credentials?

1221
01:07:48,504 --> 01:07:49,984
Wall Street, right?
Doc tell you that?

1222
01:07:50,038 --> 01:07:51,540
Doc ain't tell me shit.

1223
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:57,246
Just a educated guess
from an uneducated man.

1224
01:07:57,379 --> 01:07:59,724
Well, Bats, I would be fascinated to
hear your thoughts on the matter.

1225
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:01,383
Tell me if I'm way off,
Buddy.

1226
01:08:01,517 --> 01:08:04,886
You were a stockbroker.
Maybe a different wife, maybe kids.

1227
01:08:06,388 --> 01:08:08,190
You stack your paper,
but you say shit like,

1228
01:08:08,324 --> 01:08:10,302
"Work hard, play harder," but
you play a little too hard.

1229
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:14,463
You rack up debt, the type of debt
that'd make a white man blush.

1230
01:08:14,596 --> 01:08:16,232
Maybe you get into
a little trouble.

1231
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:18,009
Maybe you get your hand caught
in the corporate cookie jar.

1232
01:08:18,033 --> 01:08:19,544
Maybe you leave and
run off to the desert.

1233
01:08:19,568 --> 01:08:21,270
Maybe with your
favorite lap dancer in tow.

1234
01:08:21,403 --> 01:08:23,381
Maybe you disappear into a world
consisting of three things,

1235
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:27,008
money, sex, drugs and action.

1236
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:30,679
Oh, shit, that's four.

1237
01:08:32,348 --> 01:08:33,449
Am I close?

1238
01:08:34,983 --> 01:08:36,185
This how I look at it.

1239
01:08:36,318 --> 01:08:38,687
You guys just think
this is a trip.

1240
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,856
Either way,
if you are Wall Street,

1241
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:43,292
you're a bigger fucking crook
than I could ever be.

1242
01:08:47,429 --> 01:08:50,432
I'm gonna go right ahead
and speak for the two of us.

1243
01:08:55,404 --> 01:08:57,906
You think you know us?
You don't.

1244
01:08:58,039 --> 01:08:59,508
Mmm.

1245
01:08:59,641 --> 01:09:01,743
You think you're
the last word in crazy?

1246
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,147
You're not.

1247
01:09:05,281 --> 01:09:07,316
And believe me
when I tell you,

1248
01:09:07,449 --> 01:09:10,519
you don't want to
see my Buddy mad.

1249
01:09:10,652 --> 01:09:14,022
You haven't seen
how relentless he is.

1250
01:09:14,156 --> 01:09:15,857
Because when he sees red,

1251
01:09:15,991 --> 01:09:20,061
you will
see nothing but black.

1252
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:27,179
You hear that, Speedy?
That's some Oscar shit right there.

1253
01:09:27,203 --> 01:09:29,338
That was nice.
Did you rehearse that?

1254
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,106
You see this shit, Baby?

1255
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:35,277
See, now this is a prime example
of a man who loves a woman.

1256
01:09:36,578 --> 01:09:37,978
You guys are
perfect for each other.

01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:46,188
Well,

they call me on the phone and

1313
01:12:45,467 --> 01:12:47,111
The only way they can ID us is
with a Ouija board or some shit.

1314
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:49,938
Well, your name only takes
four letters to spell out.

1315
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:52,107
Doc, Bats ain't
my real fucking name.

1316
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:55,844
It's over, Leon.

1317
01:12:57,145 --> 01:12:58,814
Get out of town.

1318
01:12:59,648 --> 01:13:01,483
Wow.

1319
01:13:01,617 --> 01:13:03,752
Well, I ain't running, Doc.

1320
01:13:03,885 --> 01:13:07,423
I say we drive into the storm.
Ride the hurricane.

1321
01:13:07,556 --> 01:13:09,090
We could be on
a non-extradition beach,

1322
01:13:09,224 --> 01:13:10,759
drinking
non-extradition cocktails,

1323
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:13,995
counting our non-extradition
cash in 23 hours.

1324
01:13:14,129 --> 01:13:15,673
And who do we get
to fence those money orders

1325
01:13:15,697 --> 01:13:17,833
since you shot the fence?

1326
01:13:17,966 --> 01:13:19,868
Buddy got a guy.

1327
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:22,046
I mean, I'm just taking a wild
guess here, but Buddy got a guy.

1328
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:23,939
Ain't that right,
Wall Street?

1329
01:13:25,407 --> 01:13:27,275
Yeah, I got a guy.

1330
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:29,010
So let's fucking do this.

01:13:29,978 --> 01:13:31,480

01:18:19,935 --> 01:18:22,437
Hello? Hello, testing.

1409
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:25,340
It's Debbie. Debora.

1410
01:18:25,473 --> 01:18:28,143
Yeah, except I'm D-E-B-O-R-A.

1411
01:18:28,276 --> 01:18:30,879
"Debora." Isn't that the
waitress from the diner?

1412
01:18:32,647 --> 01:18:34,783
You said you
didn't know that bitch.

1413
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,952
Why would you say
you didn't know her?

1414
01:18:37,085 --> 01:18:39,154
Have you been
talking to Debora about us?

1415
01:18:39,287 --> 01:18:40,355
I don't say nothing.

1416
01:18:40,488 --> 01:18:41,489
What about Wheels?

1417
01:18:41,622 --> 01:18:43,458
He can't say nothing.

1418
01:18:43,591 --> 01:18:45,669
Yeah, but he can read motherfucking
lips, though, can't he?

1419
01:18:45,693 --> 01:18:47,628
Take this fool
back to his shithole.

1420
01:18:47,763 --> 01:18:49,630
I'll find another
driver for tomorrow.

1421
01:18:49,765 --> 01:18:51,909
Doc, I'm available. I can take
him where he needs to go,

1422
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:53,134
get him home safe.

1423
01:18:53,268 --> 01:18:55,136
No, you're not
getting a new driver.

1424
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,538
I've been on every job
since we met.

1425
01:18:57,672 --> 01:18:59,875
I don't squeal to the cops,
I squeal on the road.

1426
01:19:00,008 --> 01:19:01,542
And I'm not slow, I'm fast.

1427
01:19:03,812 --> 01:19:06,147
I'm your driver tomorrow.

1428
01:19:06,281 --> 01:19:07,648
I'm driving.

1429
01:19:10,952 --> 01:19:14,689
Well, you heard the kid.
He's driving.

1430
01:19:18,927 --> 01:19:20,195
I'll tell him.

1431
01:19:23,264 --> 01:19:24,742
The Atlanta region is under

1432
01:19:24,766 --> 01:19:26,143

thunderstorm advisory

1433
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:27,635

expected to show up around...

1435
01:19:29,938 --> 01:19:31,348
In downtown Atlanta today

1436
01:19:31,372 --> 01:19:32,908
due to the ongoing
construction work

1437
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:34,709

of Ted Turner and...

1438
01:19:34,843 --> 01:19:36,277
Chance of scattered

1439
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:38,011

1440
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:40,816
Low tonight about 40.
Tomorrow mostly sunny, 66.

1441
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:46,321
Remember, what's in there is ours.
Belongs to us.

1442
01:19:47,956 --> 01:19:50,425
They got our money.

1443
01:19:50,558 --> 01:19:52,560
They got our mama's jewels.

1444
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:58,967
So let's go back in there
and take back what's ours.

1445
01:20:33,701 --> 01:20:34,701
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

1446
01:20:34,802 --> 01:20:36,004

How the fuck I look?

1448
01:21:08,403 --> 01:21:09,637
Mmm-mmm.

1449
01:21:27,188 --> 01:21:28,389
Drop it!

1450
01:21:32,894 --> 01:21:34,438
- Okay, Baby, let's go.
- Move!

1451
01:21:34,462 --> 01:21:35,530
Let's go! Let's go!

1452

1454
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,168

1455
01:21:40,301 --> 01:21:41,769
Baby, move!

1456
01:21:41,903 --> 01:21:43,338
Put your fucking
foot on the gas!

1457
01:21:43,471 --> 01:21:44,781
Come on, come on,
come on, come on! Go!

1458
01:21:44,805 --> 01:21:46,274
You better move this car,

1459
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:47,242
I'm-a blow your fucking head off!
Baby, move!

1460
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:48,443
Three!
Move!

1461
01:21:48,576 --> 01:21:50,011
- Two!
- Move now!

1462
01:21:50,145 --> 01:21:51,346
- One!
- Now!

1463
01:22:04,092 --> 01:22:06,061
Fuck! Fuck!

1464
01:22:06,194 --> 01:22:07,695
Come on, come on,
give me your hand!

1465
01:22:07,828 --> 01:22:09,931
Come on! Come on!

1466
01:22:10,065 --> 01:22:12,067
What did you do, Baby?

1467
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,969
What
the fuck did you do?

1468
01:22:14,102 --> 01:22:15,470
I moved.

1469
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:16,938
You moved.
I'll fucking kill you!

1470
01:22:17,072 --> 01:22:19,007
Jason!

1471
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:23,310
Drop your weapon!

1472
01:22:23,411 --> 01:22:24,445
Oh, my God!

1473
01:22:36,424 --> 01:22:37,558
Stop!

1474
01:22:44,032 --> 01:22:46,401
Put down your weapons!
Get down on the ground!

1475
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:56,877
Get back!

1476
01:22:58,379 --> 01:23:01,616
Hey, Pongo!
Hey, hey, hey!

1477
01:23:01,749 --> 01:23:03,051
Hey! Slow down!

1478
01:23:18,066 --> 01:23:19,400
Freeze or we'll shoot!

1479
01:23:19,534 --> 01:23:21,374
- Stop where you are!
- Stop!

1480
01:23:28,809 --> 01:23:30,511
Watch it!
Hey!

1481
01:23:38,186 --> 01:23:40,121
- Get out of the way!
- Out of the way!

1482
01:23:40,255 --> 01:23:41,489
Move!
Stop!

1483
01:23:48,029 --> 01:23:49,130
Hey!

1484
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,348
Shot reported at post office downtown...

1485
01:24:17,558 --> 01:24:19,518
- There he is!
- Go, go, go, go!

1486
01:24:22,063 --> 01:24:23,231
Hey!

1487
01:24:28,103 --> 01:24:29,370
Stop, or we'll shoot!

1488
01:24:31,506 --> 01:24:32,807
Hey! You can't...

1489
01:24:40,047 --> 01:24:41,982
Freeze!

1490
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:51,559
Stop right there!

1491
01:24:55,496 --> 01:24:57,432
Hey! Whoa! What?

1492
01:24:57,565 --> 01:24:59,834
The driver of the
car has escaped on foot.

1494
01:25:10,711 --> 01:25:13,080
...dangerous.

1495
01:25:31,899 --> 01:25:33,334
No fucking way!

1496
01:25:33,468 --> 01:25:35,170
Baby,
you are a fucking jinx!

1497
01:25:35,303 --> 01:25:36,823
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

1498
01:25:38,473 --> 01:25:39,607
Fuck!
Just go!

1499
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:41,409
Baby, fucking get us
out of here!

1500
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:43,844
This is your mess!
Your fault!

1501

Put down your weapon!

- Get down!
- Pull back!

1503
01:25:57,558 --> 01:25:59,260
Get an EMT here now!

1504
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:12,673
Drop your weapon! Now!

1505
01:26:20,815 --> 01:26:22,617
This is all your fault.

1506
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:28,821
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

1507

- Got three officers hit!

This is coming to you live

1529

from the scene of a police
shootout in downtown Atlanta.

1530
01:27:54,108 --> 01:27:56,210
Police tell us
that three robbers

1531
01:27:56,344 --> 01:28:00,147
entered a US Post Office branch
downtown shortly after 1:00 p.m.

1532
01:28:00,281 --> 01:28:01,616
But what started
as a robbery...

1533
01:28:01,749 --> 01:28:02,983
Shit. Oh, shit, Joe!

This is all my fault.

All right. We got to get out of here.
All right? Things are bad.

1545

Be on the lookout

1553
01:28:54,535 --> 01:28:56,270
for a 1986
purple Chevy Caprice.

1554
01:28:56,404 --> 01:28:59,740
The whereabouts of these
felons are unknown.

1555

Four policemen were wounded

under any circumstances.

1557
01:29:07,281 --> 01:29:09,917
Still at large, are considered
extremely dangerous.

1558
01:29:12,587 --> 01:29:15,590
Hello.
My name is Joseph.

1559
01:29:17,224 --> 01:29:18,593
Uh, I like TV.

1560
01:29:18,726 --> 01:29:21,429
And I also like to listen,

1561
01:29:21,562 --> 01:29:26,033
sometimes, to old records
through the vibrations.

1562
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:29,870
I like frozen peas and
meatloaf and white bread

1563
01:29:30,004 --> 01:29:32,339
and peanut butter.

1564
01:29:34,775 --> 01:29:37,177
Spread to the edges.

1565
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,349
Please look after me.
Thank you.

1566
01:29:48,355 --> 01:29:50,157
Will you come back?

1567
01:29:52,292 --> 01:29:54,762
I don't know.

1568
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:57,565
Is everything going
to be OK?

1569
01:30:01,135 --> 01:30:04,371
I promised nothing
would happen to you.

1570
01:30:04,505 --> 01:30:07,107
And I failed.

1571
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,944
But you're safe now.

1572
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:13,614

about me.

How would you describe your
relationship with the defendant?

1803
01:46:17,377 --> 01:46:18,912
We were friends.

1804
01:46:19,045 --> 01:46:22,081
And I think we both wanted
to be more than that.

1805
01:46:22,215 --> 01:46:24,250
He got himself
into a bad spot.

1806
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:26,386
I was just
trying to get him out.

1807
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,188
I believe the defendant
is of good character.

1808
01:46:29,322 --> 01:46:31,825
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

1809
01:46:31,958 --> 01:46:34,027
Was the strangest thing.

1810
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:37,030
He finally drove off,

1811
01:46:37,163 --> 01:46:40,266
and he threw
my purse right at me.

1812
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,870
Then he actually said,
"I'm sorry."

1813
01:46:44,003 --> 01:46:46,072
He looked at
me and he shook his head,

1814
01:46:46,205 --> 01:46:49,375
like he was warning me, somehow
telling me not to go inside.

1815
01:46:49,509 --> 01:46:52,879
He looked concerned,
like he was, uh, trying to save me.

1816
01:46:53,012 --> 01:46:55,615
He made a mistake
when he was younger,

1817
01:46:55,749 --> 01:46:57,917
and it's haunted him
ever since.

1818
01:46:58,051 --> 01:47:01,387
When he tried to get out,
he was pressured even harder.

1819
01:47:01,521 --> 01:47:05,625
It was never his fault.
He's got a good heart.

1820

many times in the court case,

1831
01:47:48,868 --> 01:47:54,207
I still can't get used to the fact
that your real name is Miles.

1832
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,475
It's a cool name, though.
