1
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,795
Go, go!

2
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,389
Approaching.

3
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,807
I think we have touchdown.

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,149
Little to the right.

5
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,158
Hello, mum.

6
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,274
Now, push it in.

7
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,556
I can't.

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,073
What do you mean you can't?
Pretend it's your dick, man.

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,647
How about I pretend it's your dick?

10
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:22,153
You'll never get in if you did that.

11
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,248
- Here. Let me have a shot.
- Give me a second.

12
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:27,555
- No, come on. My dick, man.
- Go.

13
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,349
Fucker.

14
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,158
- Got that.
- Yeah.

15
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,754
Here we go.

16
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,860
Oh, look at that.

17
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,717
- Nice 155, huh?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,729
It's going to
do some fucking damage.

19
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,712
Hey, Eldridge, looks like
we're going to need a charge.

20
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,989
I got that.

21
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,431
Figured four blocks that'll
give us about 20 pounds of bang total.

22
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,991
That blast is going to
roast straight out there.

23
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,022
The shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnel

24
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,165
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern.

25
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,065
Yep.

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,444
We're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way,

27
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:16,413
but we'll be okay
if we're behind the Humvee.

28
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:18,391
- Bring the bot back, we'll load it up.
- No problem.

29
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,639
Bot is moving.

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,519
Let me know what you got, Eldridge.

31
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,886
Good to go.

32
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,599
All right. Wagon's
set up. Bot moves.

33
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,929
Uh-oh. We got goats, guys.

34
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:48,831
Goats 12:00. Watch out.

35
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,958
Load them little bastards up.

36
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,352
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

37
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,429
Oh, fuck.

38
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,606
Wagon's having a bad day, boys.

39
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:15,557
- You build that?
- No, the U.S. Army did.

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,796
All right. Looks like
I'm going down there.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,885
You don't like waiting around
this beautiful neighborhood?

42
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:20,836
Oh, I love it.

43
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,709
So, if everything looks okay,
when I get down there

44
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,986
I'm just going
to set it up and bip it.

45
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:36,877
Give these people
something to think about.

46
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,725
Want them to know if they're gonna leave
a bomb on the side of the road for us,

47
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,409
we're just going to blow up
their little fuckin' road.

48
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:42,309
Sounds good.

49
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,605
Craving a burger; is that strange?

50
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:47,352
- Not for you.
- No, okay.

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,789
Helmet on.

52
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,989
Happy trails.

53
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,607
Blaster One, can you read me?

54
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,750
Roger that, Blaster one.
You're good to go.

55
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,919
You're looking good, Blaster One.

56
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,589
Nice and hot in here.

57
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,469
One fifty.

58
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,598
Roger that, 150 meters

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,036
Hi.

60
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,128
- Where are you from?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

61
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,599
Where are you from?
Where are you from?

62
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,965
California?

63
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:01,314
- Hey, get out of here, man.
- Where?

64
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,670
Hey, this ain't no fuckin' meet
and greet. Now get out of here.

65
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,280
Now.

66
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
Go.

67
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,678
You making friends again, Sanborn?

68
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,309
All day long.

69
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,439
Twenty-five.

70
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,672
Twenty-five meters. Roger that.
You are now in the kill zone.

71
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,192
Thanks for reminding me.

72
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,238
That's what I'm here for, baby.

73
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,555
Okay-

74
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,193
The debts look good.

75
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,036
Roger that,

76
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,712
I'm laying on the charge.

77
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,993
Nice and sweet.

78
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,073
We're good to go.

79
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,869
I'm coming back.

80
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,077
- Five meters out.
- Five meters, Roger that.

81
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,524
Hey, Sanborn

82
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:39,910
- You know what this place needs?
- I'm listening.

83
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,549
Needs grass.

84
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,969
We gonna start our grass business?

85
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,029
That's right, man

86
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,956
I'm going to sell the grass,
you're going to cut it.

87
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,190
It's going to be called
"Sanborn and Sons".

88
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,074
We'll be rich.

89
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,677
I like that, Crabgass.
St. Augustine, man.

90
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,348
I'm a scholar on this shit.

91
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,994
How about this?
You sell it. I fertilize it.

92
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,794
- 25.
- 25 meters. Roger that.

93
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,309
Sanborn!

94
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,230
Butcher shop, 2:00,
dude has a phone!

95
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,549
Why is Eldridge running?

96
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,510
- Make him put it down!
- Put down the phone!

97
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,279
Come on, guys. Talk to me.

98
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,994
Drop the phone!
Drop your phone!

99
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,404
Hey, burn him, Eldridge. Burn him!

100
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,835
- Put down the cell phone!
- Eldridge, burn him!

101
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,609
- Get out of the way.
- Drop your phone!

102
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,477
Make him put it down!
Go get it!

103
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,710
- Come on, Eldridge!
- I can't get him in sight!

104
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,833
Thompson!

105
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,875
Anywhere's good.

106
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,392
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

107
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,040
Yeah?

108
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,349
Come in,

109
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,788
Sergeant James.

110
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,969
JT Sanborn, my man.

111
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:35,926
Hey. Hi, how are you? Will.
I'm Will.

112
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,928
Welcome to Bravo Company;
welcome to Camp Victory.

113
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:40,487
Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty.

114
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:43,250
Oh, no. They changed
that about a week ago.

115
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:44,469
Victory sounds better.

116
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,299
All right. Well, at least
I'm in the right place, right?

117
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:47,965
Yeah.

118
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,926
While you're here, can you help me
move this thing real quick?

119
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:50,964
Yeah, no problem.

120
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:53,005
Maybe you shouldn't take this down.

121
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:54,567
We get a lot of mortars at night.

122
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,729
The plywood on the windows help
with the lateral fray coming through.

123
00:10:57,828 --> 00:10:58,844
That's why it's up there.

124
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:01,327
Yeah, well, it's not going
to stop a mortar round

125
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,799
from coming in through
the roof, you know.

126
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,993
Besides, I like the sunshine.

127
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,445
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson.

128
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,750
- I know he was a good tech.
- Yeah, he was.

129
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,089
He was a great team leader too.

130
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,929
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fill his shoes or anything.

131
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,558
I'm just...
I'm just going to do my best.

132
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,555
- Appreciate it.
- All right.

133
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,069
Cool.

134
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,753
Home sweet home, right?

135
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,388
Aren't you glad the Army has
all these tanks parked here?

136
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,314
Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battle.

137
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,387
I'd rather be
on the side with the tanks,

138
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:44,204
just in case, rather than not have them.

139
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,554
Yeah, but they don't do anything.

140
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,520
Anyone comes alongside
a Humvee we're dead.

141
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,792
Anybody even looks
at you funny we're dead.

142
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,849
Pretty much the bottom line is
if you're in Iraq, you're dead.

143
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:55,549
How's a fuckin' tank
supposed to stop that?

144
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,029
- Would you shut up, Owen?
- Sorry.

145
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,199
Just trying to scare the new guy.

146
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,956
I saw a little bit in Afghanistan too.

147
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,154
- Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge.
- Copy that.

148
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,229
Move.

149
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,555
Move!

150
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,168
Blaster One, this is Victory Main.

151
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:02,390
Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over.

152
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,553
Where the hell are the guys
who called this in?

153
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,949
Victory Main. Victory Main.
this is Blaster Mike.

154
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,920
Interrogative, do you have
an update on position? Over.

155
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,395
Victory Main, figures to follow.
Three-four-five-three is your grid.

156
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,566
Well, that's exactly where the hell I am
and I don't see anybody in fatigues.

157
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,676
Give us a second to confirm.

158
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,844
Watch your feet.

159
00:13:56,944 --> 00:14:00,276
Set visual
is three-four five-three.

160
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,188
Got the Humvee.

161
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,588
Friendly!

162
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,470
Friendly.

163
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,388
Ah, here we go.

164
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,527
They abandoned their vehicle.

165
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:33,795
We got an empty Humvee
over here, James.

166
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,951
Yeah, I got it.

167
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,870
Let's move.

168
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,349
Friendly.

169
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,797
- Morning, boys.
- Sir.

170
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,078
Don't tell me the bomb's
in here with you guys.

171
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,657
Step out and I'll
show you what's going on.

172
00:14:54,757 --> 00:14:55,365
All right.

173
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:57,317
Down on that block 20 meters,

174
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,346
this side of the mosque,
east side of the street,

175
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:01,266
our informant says he saw
a pair of wires

176
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:02,759
going into a rubble pile.

177
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,518
- It's a possible IED.
- Yeah.

178
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,332
- I trust this guy. I know him.
- Okay.

179
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:07,093
I'll handle it.

180
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:08,406
- Do you want to talk him or...
- No.

181
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,675
Good. Keep your boys back.
We'll be good. Thank you.

182
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,308
Specialist, bring up the Humvee.

183
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:14,208
What's going on?

184
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,349
I'm going to break out the suit.

185
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,791
- What about the bot?
- I'll take care of it.

186
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,008
Don't you want to send the bot down
there to see what it looks like?

187
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,005
I'll handle it.

188
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:24,036
That's kind of tight down here, James.

189
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,030
Ready?

190
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,670
Good?

191
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,406
You don't have to go down there.
We already have the bot halfway up.

192
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:58,469
I'll be all right.

193
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,237
First day, figure you want
to take it easy, right?

194
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,525
How's it looking, Eldridge?

195
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,953
- Good to go.
- Let's do it.

196
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,849
- Got two of 'em?
- Got two.

197
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,512
All right. Let's rock and roll, man.

198
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,029
- He's a rowdy boy.
- He's reckless.

199
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,919
Blaster One, what's going on?

200
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,998
Blaster One! What are you doing?

201
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,369
Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike.

202
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,078
What's with the smoke
on the side of the road?

203
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,549
Hey. James, can you hear me?

204
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:24,791
What's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? Over.

205
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,444
Creating a diversion

206
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:28,748
From what? Is there a threat?

207
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,152
Eldridge, get up on the wall. Move!

208
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,119
Tell me what you see, specialist.

209
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,114
All right, I got him.

210
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,687
He's walking down range.

211
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:42,247
James, the smoke
is killing my visibility.

212
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:44,274
Where are you
in relationship to the IED?

213
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:45,790
Are you within 100 meters yet?

214
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,756
Hell, I don't know, but I'll tell you
when I'm standing over it, cowboy.

215
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,554
Take cover!

216
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,908
Oh, no. A car stopped
in front of him, Sanborn

217
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,769
Shit. James! James, come back now.

218
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,796
EOD pulled a nine
on this Haji in a car.

219
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,749
Want me to send backup?

220
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,515
I got it.

221
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,870
- Get here!
- Negative! Negative!

222
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,204
Stand down.

223
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:51,077
The blast will come up the block.

224
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,969
Stay clear around the corner.

225
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:55,759
EOD has the situation
under control, over.

226
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,195
Where you going?

227
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,428
Want to back up?

228
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,629
Get out of the car!

229
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,719
- Get out of the car!
- Come on!

230
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,079
What the fuck are you doing?

231
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,310
Back up.

232
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,594
Hello?

233
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,069
Want to get back?

234
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,035
It's that way.

235
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,909
Back.

236
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,248
Taxi's moving.

237
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,959
Get out of the car!
Stop!

238
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,595
Stay down!

239
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,749
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent.
he sure the hell is now.

240
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,638
Roger that. That's real funny.

241
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,430
Got something.

242
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,829
Oh, baby.

243
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,555
Gotcha.

244
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,590
All right.

245
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,159
We're done.

246
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,888
Good to go.

247
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:54,359
Come down, specialist.

248
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,670
Roger.

249
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,829
Got a wire.

250
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,349
Hang on.

251
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,552
Where are you going?

252
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,909
Secondary.

253
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,888
Shit.

254
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:39,552
Take cover. Get in the wall.
Get in the wall.

255
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,954
That wasn't so bad. First time working
together. What do you think?

256
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,272
I think us working together means
I talk to you and you talk to me.

257
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,270
- We going on a date, Sanborn?
- No.

258
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,948
We're going on a mission,

259
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,073
and my job is to keep you safe
so we can keep going on missions.

260
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,634
It's combat, buddy.

261
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,040
Hey.

262
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,767
It's just 39 days.

263
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:51,319
Thirty-eight if we survive today.

264
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,598
Hey, it's "Mr. Be All You Can Be".

265
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,516
What's up, doc?

266
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,035
Not much. How are you?

267
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,840
I'm good.

268
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,997
Got a question about that
song, "Be All You Can Be".

269
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,753
What if all I can be is dead
on the side of an Iraqi road?

270
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,409
I mean, I think it's logical.

271
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,474
This is war. People die
all the time. Why not me?

272
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,835
You got to change
the record in our head.

273
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,552
You gotta start thinking
about other things.

274
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,233
Okay.
Stop obsessing... Right now.

275
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,513
What are you thinking about?

276
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,552
You want to know
what I'm thinking about, doc? Yeah.

277
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,714
This is what I'm thinking about, doc.

278
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,599
Here's Thompson, okay.
He's dead. He's alive.

279
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,273
Here's Thompson.
He's dead. He's alive.

280
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,039
He's dead. He's alive.

281
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,245
Yo, what's up, my nigger?
What's up, man? You cool?

282
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:05,498
Come on. You want the cool shit?

283
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:07,169
Come on, come on.
It's the tight shit, man.

284
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:09,567
Wanna buy DVD?
Wanna buy DVD?

285
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:11,517
Fuck you.
Come, come, please, please.

286
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,244
New releases. Look.

287
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:15,675
Hello. Hello.
Want to buy DVDs? Very good. Very good.

288
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,729
How much?

289
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:18,169
One for five and two for nine.

290
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,275
Three for twelve.

291
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,130
Three for thirteen and I don't
give you tax. Very good, man. Look.

292
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,968
- Look...
- No tax?

293
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:25,792
All right. What do you got?
What do you got.

294
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,205
You know, you smart shit.
You not like those stupid fucks.

295
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:30,793
Yeah, I'm the smart guy.

296
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,326
You're a smart kid.
Give me your best one, okay?

297
00:27:34,426 --> 00:27:36,807
- Here, this the best one.
- This is a good one?

298
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,871
- Yeah. The best shit, man.
- Okay.

299
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,504
Here you go,
I'll take one.

300
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:42,367
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

301
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,310
Want a cigarette?

302
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,592
Get out of here.
You shouldn't smoke.

303
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,953
Thank you. Take it easy.

304
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,719
I need to talk to you about
something before we go out again.

305
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,630
What's that?

306
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,351
- Yesterday.
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,629
Wasn't cool.

308
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,192
Yeah, I know.
You'll get it, though.

309
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,434
- So, you're a ranger, huh?
- Yeah.

310
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,152
I was in intelligence seven years
before I joined EOD.

311
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,150
We ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine.

312
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,315
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a
piece of redneck trailer trash like you.

313
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,998
Looks like you're on the right track.

314
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,115
We'll see you out there.

315
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,195
Let's go, move!

316
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,193
Shit. Get out of the way. Move.

317
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,315
Hallo.

318
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,705
- Where is it?
- It's behind the wall.

319
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:09,084
- All right.
- See any wires? Any smoke?

320
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:10,204
No, I didn't look.

321
00:29:10,305 --> 00:29:11,288
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

322
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:13,565
Car has been parked illegally.

323
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:16,606
The suspension is sagging. There's
definitely something heavy in the trunk.

324
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:19,877
Right. So, why don't you walk over there
and peak inside and tell me what you see.

325
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,838
You want me to go close to it?

326
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,989
Yeah. No-no. I don't. I'm kidding.

327
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,390
Shit.

328
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,079
It's coming from over here!

329
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,515
Blaster One. You there?

330
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,708
Blaster One, you hear me?

331
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,508
Here.

332
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,440
Shit.

333
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,353
Let's go, guys.

334
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,435
Let it go.

335
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,474
I got top cover.

336
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,604
That's a negative, specialist.

337
00:30:54,705 --> 00:30:55,927
Eldridge, you stay with me.

338
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:57,449
Sanborn, you take top covers.

339
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,350
Shit.

340
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,108
Blaster Mike in position.

341
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,470
What do you got?

342
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,189
I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stable.

343
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,115
He's not going to make it.

344
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,329
We're leaving in 15 minutes.

345
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,753
Got a survival wound, sir.

346
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,389
He's not going to make it.

347
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,836
Oh, God.

348
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,398
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

349
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,764
What are you doing?

350
00:33:00,865 --> 00:33:02,831
There's enough bang in there
to send us all to Jesus.

351
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,556
If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die comfortable.

352
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,552
I need my kit and my cans.

353
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,353
What's going on down there, Eldridge?

354
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,553
I'm getting his kit and his cans.
Cover me, please.

355
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,879
Kit and cans.

356
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,596
Got a lot of deck cord, electrical.

357
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,598
I'm looking for this initiating system.

358
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,873
Well, it's not in the back seat.

359
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,634
I don't think.

360
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,638
All right. It's not in the back seat.

361
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,397
Got a young man on the roof,
your 9:00, keep an eye on him.

362
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,510
Roger that.

363
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,475
It's not in the front seat.

364
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,959
It's not in the door.

365
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,275
Not on the floors.

366
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,835
Not in the glove box.

367
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,487
If you haven't found it yet.
it's probably under the car.

368
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:40,189
Yeah. No wire leads under... the car.
It's all in here somewhere.

369
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,728
- Hey, Sanborn.
- Yeah.

370
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:51,626
You got eyes on some guy.
with a video camera?

371
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:52,675
No. Where?

372
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,476
He's right at my 12:00, you see him?
He's pointing the fucking thing at me.

373
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,573
Shit.

374
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:08,868
Negative, I don't see him.

375
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,597
Hey, Sanborn. He's right
at my 12:00. Look! 12:00!

376
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,915
Roger that, I got him.

377
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,257
Getting ready to put me on You Tube.

378
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,947
Little shady.

379
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:24,834
Yeah, he looks shady.
Keep and eye on him.

380
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,633
Okay. So, what's the play?

381
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,270
Be smart. Make a good decision, over

382
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,388
Got more wire.

383
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,351
Leads fucking nowhere.

384
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,109
Fuck!

385
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,514
Hey, James, how you doing?

386
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,759
I'm wonderful. How are you?

387
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,393
You know, we've been here a while.

388
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,474
We need to get out of here soon.

389
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,516
Uh-huh.

390
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,999
We got a lot of eyes on us, James.
We need to get out of here.

391
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,472
Roger that. I'm going
to figure this out.

392
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,399
James, we need to get out of here.

393
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,433
James, do you copy?

394
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,713
Fuck it. I get it.

395
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,154
Fuck me.

396
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,993
Hey, how's it looking in there, soldier?

397
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:33,943
All clear.

398
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,766
James, the evac
is complete. We can leave.

399
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:38,186
Let the engineers handle this mess.

400
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:40,271
- We moving?
- That's affirmative.

401
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,029
Interesting.

402
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,071
What's up with James?
He's not answering.

403
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,196
Yeah, I think he removed his headset.

404
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,118
Well, will you tell him to
put his radio back on, please?

405
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,727
Hey, James!

406
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:09,759
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if
you'll please put your headset back on.

407
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,912
Uh... that's a negative.

408
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,998
That, yeah, that's not going to happen.

409
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,399
I got eyes on three guys
at the Minaret at 6:00.

410
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,525
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

411
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,238
Looks like, he's checking the oil.

412
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,352
They're communicating
with your cameraman.

413
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,047
This is real bad man.

414
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:42,473
Get behind the Jersey barrier.

415
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,118
I can't see James from here.

416
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,429
Get down now!

417
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,959
We can go!

418
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,430
Bastard.

419
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,709
We're done.

420
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,752
Sanborn, let's get out of here.

421
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,155
Woo.

422
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,316
That was good.

423
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,079
- Hey, James.
- What?

424
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,351
Never turn your headset off again.

425
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,639
You the guy in the bomb suit?

426
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,800
No, sir. Sir, that's Sergeant James.
He's right here.

427
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,713
- Hey. James.
- Yeah?

428
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,315
Someone's here to see you.

429
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,247
You the guy in the flaming car,
Sergeant James?

430
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:56,958
Afternoon, sir.
Uh, yes, sir.

431
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,593
Well, that's just hot shit.

432
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,757
You're a wild man, you know that?

433
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,152
- Uh, yes, sir.
- He's a wild man.

434
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,315
You know that?

435
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,355
I want to shake your hand.

436
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,189
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

437
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,789
How many bombs have you disarmed?

438
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,768
Uh, I'm not quite sure.

439
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:15,984
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

440
00:42:16,084 --> 00:42:17,195
I asked you a question.

441
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,285
Eight hundred seventy-three, sir.

442
00:42:20,385 --> 00:42:24,114
Eight hundred! And seventy-three.

443
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,634
That's just hot shit.

444
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,472
Eight-hundred and seventy-three.

445
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,111
- Counting today, sir, yes.
- That's gotta be a record.

446
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,718
What's the best way to... go about
disarming one of these things?

447
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,519
The way you don't die, sir.

448
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,349
That's a good one.

449
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,193
That's spoken
like a wild man. That's good.

450
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,768
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Oh, hey, wait a minute.

451
00:43:04,868 --> 00:43:06,074
Look who it is.

452
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,959
I want my five bucks back, buddy.

453
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,168
Five dollars for what, man?
You crazy now?

454
00:43:11,268 --> 00:43:13,088
Yeah. The DVD you sold me was crap.

455
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:16,126
You crazy, man. That's impossible.
It's Hollywood special effects.

456
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,686
No. It was shaky.
It was out of focus, buddy.

457
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:19,127
- What, you want donkey porn?
- It's crap.

458
00:43:19,227 --> 00:43:21,248
- Girls on dog?
- Gay sex, man?

459
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,639
Anything you want, you get.

460
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,830
I hook you up, man.

461
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,649
All right. What... what's your name?

462
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:28,685
- Beckham.
- Beckham like the soccer player?

463
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:30,727
Yeah, man. It's like soccer player.
Now give me my ball.

464
00:43:30,828 --> 00:43:31,884
Are you a soccer player?

465
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,809
Yeah, man. Best of the best.
I'm better than Beckham.

466
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:35,579
You play goalie?

467
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,030
- Yes, I play goalie.
- Okay.

468
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,513
I'll make you a deal. If you can stop the
ball, I'm going to give you five bucks,

469
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,005
- but if you can't...
- And what if... what if I can't?

470
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:47,072
Listen to me. If I score,
I'm going to keep your ball.

471
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,389
- Deal?
- Deal.

472
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,285
Get up there.

473
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:53,794
Go on.

474
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,838
- Let's see what you got hot stuff.
- Are you ready?

475
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,548
On three. Ready?

476
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,872
One, two, three. Aahh!

477
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,188
Shit.

478
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:10,927
Come on. Where's the five dollars?
Man, come on.

479
00:44:11,028 --> 00:44:13,349
All right, I got ya.
Good job, dude.

480
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,595
Here's five.

481
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,967
You're an EOD, boomala, boomala.

482
00:44:18,068 --> 00:44:19,008
That's right.

483
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:20,044
It's fun, no?

484
00:44:20,144 --> 00:44:21,633
It's cool? It's gangster.

485
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,038
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I think so.

486
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,109
Tell you what, I'm going to buy...

487
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,517
Let me see if I have
enough money, yeah. Five.

488
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,231
I'm going to buy another DVD, okay?

489
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,873
But if it's shakey... look at me...
or out of focus...

490
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,391
or any way not 100%.

491
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,599
I'm going to chop off your goddammed
head with a dull knife.

492
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,910
How do you feel about that?
I'm just kidding.

493
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,274
Here. You're a good kid, man.
You're a good kid, aren't ya?

494
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,675
Owen.

495
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,880
Hi.

496
00:44:55,964 --> 00:44:57,069
- Hi, sir.
- How are you?

497
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,188
- I'm good.
- Good.

498
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,835
- What's wrong?
- Brakes are squeaking.

499
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,516
Don't trust the mechanics
around here. You know.

500
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,716
- So, how you doing?
- Good.

501
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,468
I just want to check the oil.

502
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,748
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well...

503
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,596
I'm feeling pretty squared
away, actually, doc.

504
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,994
Good to hear it.

505
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,114
So, you getting along with the other
soldiers in your unit?

506
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,714
Yeah. My team's great.
My team leader is inspiring.

507
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,238
- Are you being sarcastic, soldier?
- No.

508
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,913
He's going to get me killed,

509
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,919
almost died yesterday.

510
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,639
At least I'll die in the line
of duty, proud and strong.

511
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,116
You know, this doesn't have
to be a bad time in your life.

512
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,638
Going to war is a- is a once
in a lifetime experience.

513
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,109
It could be fun.

514
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,050
And you know this from your
extensive work in the field, right?

515
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,473
I've done my field duty.

516
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,553
Where's that? Yale?

517
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,209
Look, you don't want me to come around,
I won't come around.

518
00:45:57,309 --> 00:45:58,508
These talks are voluntary.

519
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,235
Look, I'm sorry,

520
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,310
I appreciate
what you're saying, I do.

521
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,118
I appreciate our sessions together,

522
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,750
but you need to come out from
behind the wire, see what we do.

523
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,230
Well,

524
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,751
if this circumstance calls for it,
I will.

525
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,439
Just like every other soldier

526
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,009
Fire in the hole!

527
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,354
Firing now.

528
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,750
Eee, ooh...

529
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,792
- Ready for second det?
- Ready.

530
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,685
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole. Fire in the hole.

531
00:46:36,786 --> 00:46:38,193
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second.

532
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,038
Goddamn it,
I think it forgot my gloves down there.

533
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,958
- What?
- I forgot my gloves.

534
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,236
Hang on.

535
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,675
You know, these detonators
misfire all the time.

536
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,189
What are you doing?

537
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,435
I'm just saying shit happens,
they misfire.

538
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,351
He'd be obliterated to nothing.

539
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,917
His helmet would be left.
You could have that.

540
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,874
Little specs of hair,
charred on the inside.

541
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,957
Yeah. There'd be half
a helmet somewhere,

542
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,995
bits of hair.

543
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,450
Ask for a change
in technique and protocol,

544
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,909
make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?

545
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,553
You'd have to write the report.

546
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,395
- Are you serious?
- I can't write it.

547
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,110
No. I mean, are you serious
about killing him?

548
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,512
- Twelve o'clock I see an SUV.
- Roger that.

549
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,438
I got four armed men.

550
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,353
They're in Haji gear.

551
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,558
All right. Go slow and easy.

552
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,992
Careful now.

553
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,837
All right. Careful now, guys.

554
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,430
- Eldridge, you stay on that 50.
- I got 'em.

555
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,885
"Obre... obre..."
put your gun down!

556
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:15,547
On your knees!
Put your gun down!

557
00:49:15,647 --> 00:49:18,648
- Obre, motherfucker!
- Hold up your hands.

558
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:20,711
Get down, motherfucker. Obre!

559
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,310
Put your gun down now!

560
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,512
Put your gun down!

561
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,033
Advance, advance...

562
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,714
Hands high.

563
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,556
- Eldridge, cover!
- I got you.

564
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,712
Pistol, off your hip, now.

565
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,120
What you want me to do?

566
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:05,792
Keep
my hands up or take off the pistol?

567
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,838
- Keep your hands up.
- Okay.

568
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,553
Easy, easy.

569
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,075
Got it!

570
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,793
Can I touch my fucking head now?

571
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,360
Slowly.

572
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,910
We're on the same fucking side, guys.

573
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,150
Jesus.

574
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,846
You guys are wired fucking tight,
you know that?

575
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:41,849
Well, this is no place for a picnic.
What are you guys doing here?

576
00:50:41,949 --> 00:50:43,609
We have a flat tire.
Can you help us?

577
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:45,209
Sure, yeah. You got any spares?

578
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:47,111
We have spares, but
we've used up our wrench.

579
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,588
How do you use up a wrench?

580
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,247
Well, the uh, the guy over there
with the red thing on his head.

581
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:52,315
He threw it at someone.

582
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,828
- All right.
- Thank you.

583
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,553
That's Chris. This is the wrench man.

584
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,925
Hello, wrench man. That's Jimmy.

585
00:51:04,025 --> 00:51:06,285
You know, you can shoot people here.
You don't have to throw a wrench at 'em.

586
00:51:06,385 --> 00:51:07,236
Fuck off.

587
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,869
Take a look at this.

588
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,358
I picked these guys up in Najaf.

589
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,879
Nine of hearts, that's one.

590
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,434
And the other...
jack of clubs.

591
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,992
- These the same guys?
- Yep. That's them.

592
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,629
Does he need a little help there?

593
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,952
What's the problem
with the tire? Come on.

594
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,590
No good, boss.
This wrench is too small.

595
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,194
All right, solutions? Anyone?

596
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,727
I think there's another wrench in the
back of the Humvee if you want to check.

597
00:51:49,827 --> 00:51:51,153
- I'll give it a try.
- All right. Let's do it.

598
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,954
How long you guys out here?

599
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,551
Specialist, what do we got?

600
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,794
- We have... 23 more days or 22...
- Oh yeah.

601
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,517
No one's counting.

602
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,432
Contact left.

603
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,839
Take cover,

604
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,847
Chris, take the 50, Jimmy,
take that in the Humvee.

605
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:27,319
- Got it.
- Come on!
