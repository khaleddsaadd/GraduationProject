1
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:57,762
Captain!

2
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,680
Is that a trench?

3
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,267
It looks like there's
more of them inside.

4
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,316
Echo 2-6 to command.

5
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,319
Colonel, we've got eyes on
three Kong in the north woods.

6
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,528
One of them is armed.

7
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,172
And our donkey
just spotted another trench.

8
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,656
Maybe the base is near.

9
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:00,992
Yes, sir.

10
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,622
Yes, sir, copy. Over.

11
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,337
Hey, donkey.

12
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,217
Preacher.

13
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,516
The one with the gun.

14
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,145
As soon as the gunner's down,
you guys take out the trench.

15
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:30,313
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

16
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,416
Fire!

17
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,176
Come on!

18
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:22,633
Reload!

19
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,817
Fall back! Fall back!

20
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,508
Colonel, do you copy?
Colonel!

21
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:46,717
<i>Who is this?</i>

22
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,219
Preacher, sir!
It's Preacher!

23
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,346
<i>Where are you, soldier?
I need your position.</i>

24
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,723
I don't know!
<i>What do you see?</i>

25
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,267
I can't see anything, sir.

26
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,519
We lost a lot of men,
and the captain is dead, sir.

27
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,771
<i>Okay, calm down.
You're in command now.</i>

28
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:00,690
Command, sir?

29
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,567
I think it's just me
all by myself now.

30
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,068
<i>Take control.</i>

31
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,532
Colonel, I don't think
I'm gonna make it, sir.

32
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,741
I'm sorry.

33
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,034
I'm so sorry, sir.

34
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,121
<i>Listen to me.
You kill as many as you can.</i>

35
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,086
No! No, no!

36
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,538
Sixty-three dead.

37
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,044
You're him.

38
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,130
You're Caesar.

39
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,801
We've been searching
for you for so long.

40
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,470
We heard you had
a hidden command base.

41
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,347
But we could never find it.

42
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,808
Some of us started to think
that you might be dead.

43
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,953
But Colonel McCullough said
you were out here somewhere.

44
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,687
- Just kill us already.
- Shut up, man!

45
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,689
What? They're animals.

46
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,816
He's gonna slaughter us.

47
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,868
I did not start this war.

48
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,540
The ape who did is dead.

49
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,335
His name was Koba.

50
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,587
I killed him.

51
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,718
Now, I fight only...

52
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,428
to protect apes.

53
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,721
Yeah?

54
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,057
What about him?

55
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,019
We've got 10 more
just like him.

56
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,938
I know these apes.

57
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,191
They follow Koba.

58
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:52,403
They tried to kill me.

59
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,240
They fear
what I will do to them.

60
00:10:56,407 --> 00:11:00,036
So now, they serve you.

61
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,246
Just to survive.

62
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:07,501
I don't fear you.

63
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,425
You must fear.

64
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:19,263
How long you think
woods can protect you?

65
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,266
Humans destroy you.

66
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:27,438
Their Kerna has all power.

67
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,234
For them,
he more than just human.

68
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,405
He everything.

69
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:40,493
He say: First Caesar die...

70
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:45,206
then all of you die.

71
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,548
Winter! Take this traitor outside!

72
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,850
What should we do with the humans?

73
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:19,990
You're letting us go?

74
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:24,036
Tell your Colonel
you have seen me now...

75
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:27,289
and I have a message for him.

76
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:31,669
Leave us the woods,
and the killing can stop.

77
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,099
Do you think they will
give him the message?

78
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,184
They are the message,
Maurice.

79
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,021
He will see
we are not savages.

80
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:02,408
The traitor attacked me! He got away!

81
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:30,895
Koba...

82
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,230
still haunts us.

83
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,735
Why didn't I see...

84
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:42,156
that he could not forgive
what humans did to him?

85
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:47,828
No one could have known
how much darkness...

86
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:50,956
was living inside him.

87
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,701
Father...!

88
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,843
Welcome home, Rocket.

89
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,263
You look tired.

90
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:49,473
It was a long journey.

91
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,226
Father, we found something!

92
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:53,644
Come.

93
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:21,839
Mother...!

94
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,682
Cornelius...

95
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,143
Say hi to your brother!

96
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,279
Look who's here, son...

97
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,459
Lake...

98
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,740
This is it, father...

99
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,242
We can start over... A new home.

100
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,996
What is beyond those mountains, son?

101
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:38,123
Show them, Rocket...

102
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,096
A desert!

103
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,765
The journey is long...

104
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,601
But that is why humans will not find us.

105
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,771
We must leave tonight!

106
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,482
Tonight? That's impossible!

107
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,109
How long can we wait, Lake?

108
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,152
Soldiers getting closer!

109
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,444
Winter...

110
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,707
Your son's been gone, Caesar...

111
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:24,128
He doesn't know how hard it's been.

112
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,550
I know you are scared...

113
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,344
We all are...

114
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,848
But we are still planning...

115
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,601
Yes.

116
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,981
We must find a safe way
out of the woods.

117
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,192
There were only two of you.

118
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,612
But we are... many.

119
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:04,960
We will find a way
out of here.

120
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,174
Apes together...

121
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,051
strong.

122
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,580
Stay here, son!

123
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,999
Protect your mother and brother!

124
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,837
Caesar! What's wrong?!

125
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,714
How many on patrol?

126
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,590
Five? Six?

127
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,925
Get them!

128
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,636
Luca, get Rocket, too.

129
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,358
Lima four to command.
Colonel, did you...

130
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,702
Rocket!

131
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,245
What happened?

132
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,915
I heard him talking! The Colonel is here!

133
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,044
<i>99, target acquired.</i>

134
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:39,383
<i>99, target acquired. Repeat.
King Kong is dead.</i>

135
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,511
<i>Let's go.
I can get out from here.</i>

136
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,430
Caesar...

137
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,474
We can't find Winter!

138
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:59,064
He was scared! I think he betrayed us!

139
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,446
Have you found Cornelius yet?

140
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,117
We're still searching.

141
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,707
Let's go look for Caesar's little son.

142
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,076
Cornelius!

143
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,587
You're safe now.

144
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:22,981
Lake...

145
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,483
You loved my son.

146
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:30,280
Look after his brother
until I return.

147
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:38,872
You're not coming with us to our new home?

148
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,081
No.

149
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,171
Go with Lake.

150
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:03,897
Caesar!

151
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,149
You're not going after them?!

152
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,195
Not them. Him.

153
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:14,407
Caesar, you are our leader!

154
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,952
We can't leave without you!

155
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:18,870
You must.

156
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,332
The soldiers
will be back soon.

157
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,709
Father!

158
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,504
When I find him...

159
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,547
the soldiers will
all come after me.

160
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,759
That may give you
the best chance

161
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,219
to get out of the woods.

162
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,724
Where is he going?!

163
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:46,523
Caesar! Caesar!

164
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,491
The soldiers' camp is always moving.

165
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,869
My guards think they know where it is.

166
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,370
Let me take you.

167
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,998
You need me to back you up!

168
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:46,958
No.

169
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:49,711
Please...

170
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,256
I know what it's like...

171
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,258
to lose a son.

172
00:27:56,301 --> 00:28:00,055
I may not make it back.

173
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:04,517
That's why I'm coming.

174
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:09,105
To make sure you do.

175
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,019
Guards think soldiers here...

176
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,688
Always fires burning.

177
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,662
No one here...

178
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:08,039
Search the area.

179
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,648
I'm just gonna
put this down.

180
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,018
What's he doing out here alone?

181
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,312
Maybe he's a deserter?

182
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,678
Look around.

183
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,766
Take what you can.

184
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,548
Something wrong with her.

185
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,175
I don't think she can speak.

186
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,929
Come.

187
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:55,868
She'll die out here alone.

188
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:58,413
We cannot take her, Maurice.

189
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:05,128
I understand...

190
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,798
But I cannot leave her.

191
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:20,953
Did you find the Colonel?

192
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,705
No.

193
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,541
Winter.

194
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:41,390
Where's the Colonel?

195
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,068
He's gone.

196
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:53,444
Gone?

197
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,906
He left this morning...

198
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,117
took many men with him.

199
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,579
More soldiers are coming
down from the North.

200
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,415
The Colonel is going to meet them...

201
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,668
at the border.

202
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,963
What border? Why?

203
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,719
I don't know.

204
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,764
But the rest of us are going tomorrow.

205
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,186
The donkeys think the
soldiers from the North...

206
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:31,107
are coming to help finish
off the apes for good.

207
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,069
That day, after the battle on the hill...

208
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,073
The donkey we caught promised me
the Colonel would spare my life...

209
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:42,743
If I told them where you were hiding.

210
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:46,914
Forgive me!

211
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,838
My son...

212
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:59,135
my wife...

213
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:02,138
are dead.

214
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,129
Now what do we do?

215
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,131
Wait till the soldiers go...

216
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:23,094
Follow them to the Colonel.

217
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:58,129
Koba!

218
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:00,089
Ape...

219
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:05,094
not kill ape.

220
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,939
The soldiers are leaving!

221
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,312
They stopped.

222
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:57,813
Get down!

223
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,787
What are they shooting at?

224
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:16,832
I don't know.

225
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,584
Why did they shoot you?

226
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,355
Like her!

227
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,567
He cannot speak!

228
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:13,490
He will die of those wounds.

229
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:25,169
Luca...

230
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:47,900
Where did the soldiers go?!

231
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:51,987
Winter said they were
going to a border.

232
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:54,281
Yes, but which way is that?!

233
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:45,596
Bad Ape!

234
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:53,937
Bad Ape.

235
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:58,066
Who are you?

236
00:46:58,692 --> 00:47:01,069
What are you doing here?

237
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,574
I don't think he understands.

238
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:10,120
I don't recognize him.

239
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:12,414
He's not one of us.

240
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:15,751
Are you alone here?

241
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:37,147
Cold?

242
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:54,998
Cold.

243
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:03,632
I see girl,
I think you human.

244
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:05,133
But you ape.

245
00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:07,302
Like me.

246
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,639
No, put down.

247
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:12,808
How long have
you been here?

248
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:14,268
Long time.

249
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:16,853
Long, long time.

250
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:28,657
Home.

251
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,493
Old home.

252
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,001
Are there more like you?

253
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:41,670
More apes from zoo.

254
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:44,464
Dead. All dead.

255
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,133
Long time.

256
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:49,344
Human get sick.

257
00:48:49,678 --> 00:48:52,347
Ape get smart.

258
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,641
Then human kill ape.

259
00:48:55,142 --> 00:48:56,560
But not me.

260
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:58,520
I run.

261
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,189
You learn to speak...

262
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:03,692
Listen. Human...

263
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,072
"Bad Ape!"

264
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:13,619
Bad Ape. Huh?

265
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,037
No.

266
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:17,039
No touch.

267
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,375
That's mine.

268
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:27,758
I'm okay!

269
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:39,603
Amazing...

270
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:42,064
Always thought we were the only ones.

271
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,608
Wonder if there are more in the world?

272
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,737
More apes like us.

273
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,450
Eat! Eat.

274
00:49:56,453 --> 00:49:57,954
New friends.

275
00:49:58,413 --> 00:49:59,956
Special day.

276
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:05,712
Where did you get this?

277
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:09,925
Bad place.

278
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,636
I find long time ago.

279
00:50:12,803 --> 00:50:15,389
After zoo, I look for food...

280
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:18,100
I find human zoo.

281
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:20,310
Zoo for sick.

282
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:22,896
Big walls.

283
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:25,941
Sick human climb.

284
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:29,820
Bad human kill.

285
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:33,407
And then, all get sick.

286
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,742
All dead now for a long time.

287
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:37,452
Long time.

288
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,079
Bad humans?

289
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:42,332
Soldiers?

290
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:46,336
Soldiers.

291
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:48,463
A deserted military camp!

292
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:51,258
On the border!

293
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:56,138
Maybe the Colonel and the
troops are going there?

294
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:58,974
Is it far? Can you take us?

295
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:00,934
Human zoo?

296
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:03,812
No. No, no go back there.

297
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:07,149
Everyone dead. I come here.
Very safe here.

298
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:08,483
Never go back.

299
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,152
Please, you must take us!

300
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:12,779
No! No! Cannot take!

301
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:14,990
Cannot take. No! No!

302
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:18,326
Look! Look!

303
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:21,163
More snow. Cannot go.
Must stay.

304
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:23,290
You eat, you rest.

305
00:51:23,457 --> 00:51:25,500
Stay here with me.

306
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:29,463
Here, you keep.

307
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:34,176
She keep.

308
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:03,371
Who is...

309
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:10,712
child?

310
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,548
I don't know.

311
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:18,053
But she with you.

312
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:22,390
She has no one else.

313
00:52:29,189 --> 00:52:32,567
I see you look at her
just now.

314
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:38,406
Look sad.

315
00:52:42,953 --> 00:52:45,121
You have child?

316
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,251
One.

317
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:54,589
The other was
killed by human.

318
00:52:57,217 --> 00:52:58,593
Soldier?

319
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,488
I had child.

320
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,789
You think
you will find him...

321
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:32,460
at human zoo?

322
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:39,175
With soldier?

323
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:44,848
I don't know.

324
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:48,476
Maybe.

325
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:51,938
Then...

326
00:53:57,193 --> 00:54:00,488
maybe I take you.

327
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:44,759
Thirsty.

328
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,513
Thirsty.

329
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:52,641
Thirsty.

330
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:10,577
Luca, come.
Let's go closer.

331
00:56:10,744 --> 00:56:12,078
Keep them safe.

332
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:20,170
What are they doing?

333
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:21,629
I don't know.

334
00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:29,262
What's that? A patrol?

335
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:31,681
I don't see riders.

336
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:38,813
Hold it!

337
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:42,650
I saw them coming!

338
00:57:14,182 --> 00:57:17,310
At least this time...

339
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:20,188
I was able to protect you.

340
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:33,303
Caesar...

341
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:37,265
This must stop...

342
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:39,767
It's not too late to join the other apes...

343
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:42,854
We cannot turn back!

344
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,773
Luca gave his life!

345
00:58:46,316 --> 00:58:47,734
Please...!

346
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:54,490
They must pay.

347
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:02,957
Now...

348
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:06,628
you sound like Koba.

349
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:15,136
It was a mistake
bringing you all.

350
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:16,679
This is my fight.

351
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:19,682
I will finish this alone.

352
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:22,352
Go.

353
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:23,645
Now!

354
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,105
Join the others.

355
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:56,738
What happened?

356
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:02,076
They came out of nowhere...

357
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:04,370
Attacked us.

358
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:07,540
We thought they would kill us all...

359
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:10,209
But the Colonel stopped them!

360
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:13,880
There was madness in his eyes!

361
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:18,926
He said they would use us, before we died!

362
01:01:19,594 --> 01:01:21,846
And they brought us all here!

363
01:01:23,598 --> 01:01:24,891
Use you?

364
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:29,896
They've been forcing us to work!

365
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,106
What...

366
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,776
What kind of work?

367
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:38,738
Wait.

368
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:41,407
My little son. Is he here?

369
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:55,088
Grant and Lee...

370
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:01,010
Wellington...

371
01:02:02,804 --> 01:02:04,472
and Napoleon...

372
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:08,351
Custer...

373
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:12,480
and Sitting Bull...

374
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:17,610
You're probably
not much of a reader.

375
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:22,323
But this is a big moment.

376
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:25,159
Where were you?

377
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:29,664
We came upon your herd.
We got lucky.

378
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:32,834
But I was surprised
you weren't with them.

379
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:36,003
Hey, hey, hey!

380
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:48,182
I hope you don't come
to regret sparing his life.

381
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:52,228
He's quite a good shot.

382
01:02:57,692 --> 01:03:00,903
Have you finally come
to save your apes?

383
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:03,865
I came for you.

384
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:05,533
For me?

385
01:03:08,536 --> 01:03:10,746
Who did I kill that night?

386
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:12,373
My wife.

387
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,210
My son.

388
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,724
I'm sorry.

389
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,018
I was there for you.

390
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,447
My God.

391
01:03:45,615 --> 01:03:47,742
Look at your eyes.

392
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:50,036
Almost human.

393
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:56,125
How did you know
I was here?

394
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:59,795
I was told you were coming.

395
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,758
That more soldiers
from the North...

396
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:05,885
would be joining you here.

397
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:07,136
Joining me?

398
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:09,138
To finish us off.

399
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:11,599
For good.

400
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:16,229
Who told you that?

401
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:26,822
Okay.

402
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:30,451
Let's go.

403
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,950
Father!

404
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:14,704
Father!

405
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,412
Lake...

406
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:41,082
Forgive them.

407
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:43,793
We've been through much.

408
01:06:51,092 --> 01:06:52,927
Father!

409
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:56,931
What have I done?

410
01:07:35,386 --> 01:07:37,346
Battalion, halt!

411
01:07:42,643 --> 01:07:43,686
Blood!

412
01:07:43,853 --> 01:07:45,104
Makes the grass grow!

413
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:46,813
We!

414
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,232
Make the blood flow!

415
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,817
We are the beginning!

416
01:07:49,984 --> 01:07:51,277
And the end!

417
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:37,299
We haven't had food or
water since we got here...

418
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,057
Why do they need a wall?

419
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,116
Hey!

420
01:10:04,118 --> 01:10:05,661
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

421
01:10:19,508 --> 01:10:20,509
Hey!

422
01:10:21,427 --> 01:10:22,636
Donkey!

423
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:24,763
Get him.

424
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,682
Okay, okay, okay...

425
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,796
Leave him!

426
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:39,249
Tell them to get back to work.

427
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,920
Apes need food and water.

428
01:13:45,798 --> 01:13:47,174
Tell them.

429
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,301
Give them food...

430
01:13:49,468 --> 01:13:50,803
and water.

431
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:00,104
Five...

432
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:02,523
Four...

433
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:05,109
Three...

434
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:08,237
Two...

435
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:29,216
Hurry! Back to work!

436
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,402
String him up, donkey.

437
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:01,081
Bad place.

438
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,835
Bad, bad place.

439
01:15:07,838 --> 01:15:09,381
What you see?

440
01:15:15,596 --> 01:15:16,722
Must save them!

441
01:15:16,847 --> 01:15:17,848
But how?

442
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:19,224
Must think!

443
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,810
What would Caesar do?

444
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:24,271
Oh, no!

445
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,150
Why so small?

446
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:38,368
Oh!

447
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:03,685
What did the Colonel
promise you?

448
01:16:04,353 --> 01:16:08,065
You really think
he'll let you live...

449
01:16:08,232 --> 01:16:10,025
after we are gone?

450
01:16:11,151 --> 01:16:13,695
You let them
call you "donkey."

451
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:16,406
You are ape.

452
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,627
Kerna want see you.

453
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:54,736
Interfere
with the work again...

454
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:57,990
and I'll begin slaughtering
the apes one by one.

455
01:16:58,156 --> 01:17:00,158
Understand? I need that wall.

456
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:02,953
Apes need food and water.

457
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,665
They'll get food and water
when they finish their work.

458
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:11,795
Give apes food and water...

459
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:13,922
or they cannot finish.

460
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:16,425
You know,
you are very emotional.

461
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:21,888
What makes you think you're in
a position to make demands?

462
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:28,979
Okay, let's go.

463
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:30,897
The soldiers
who are coming here...

464
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:34,067
they are not coming
to join you, are they?

465
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:40,032
I saw men outside on the wall,
preparing for battle.

466
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:44,619
They told me you were smart...

467
01:17:44,786 --> 01:17:47,748
but that's impressive.

468
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:48,999
No.

469
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:51,752
They won't be joining me.

470
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:53,670
They are against you?

471
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:56,298
They fear me.

472
01:17:56,465 --> 01:17:57,466
Why?

473
01:17:57,632 --> 01:18:00,218
Because you kill
your own men?

474
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:03,221
We found bodies.

475
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:05,474
Something wrong...

476
01:18:05,974 --> 01:18:07,768
with these men.

477
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,899
Jesus Christ,
you are impressive.

478
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:16,693
Well, you paint
quite a picture.

479
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,071
What you must think of me.

480
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:22,657
I think you have no mercy.

481
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:42,677
You came here to kill me.

482
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:46,139
Were you gonna show me mercy?

483
01:18:46,306 --> 01:18:48,392
I showed you mercy...

484
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:50,394
when I spared your men.

485
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:53,313
I offered you peace...

486
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,148
and you killed my family.

487
01:19:10,205 --> 01:19:11,331
Mercy.

488
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:15,877
You have any idea what
your mercy would do to us?

489
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:22,426
You're much stronger
than we are.

490
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:25,011
You're smart as hell.

491
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:28,056
No matter what you say,
you'd eventually replace us.

492
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:30,225
That's the law of nature.

493
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:33,228
The irony is,
we created you.

494
01:19:33,395 --> 01:19:36,231
We tried to defy nature,
bend it to our will.

495
01:19:36,398 --> 01:19:39,693
Nature has been punishing us
for our arrogance...

496
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,319
ever since.

497
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:44,906
10 months ago,

498
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,159
I sent out recon units
to look for your base.

499
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:50,454
My own son was a soldier
with one of the units.

500
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,414
One day he suddenly
stopped speaking.

501
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:55,917
He became primitive,
like an animal.

502
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:57,419
They contacted me and said

503
01:19:57,502 --> 01:19:59,629
that they thought
he'd lost his mind.

504
01:20:00,464 --> 01:20:02,632
That the war
was too much for him.

505
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:06,928
Then the man who cared for him
stopped speaking too.

506
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:11,683
Their medic had a theory,
before he stopped speaking...

507
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:15,770
that the virus
that almost wiped us out...

508
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:19,316
the virus that every human
survivor still carries...

509
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:21,818
had suddenly changed.

510
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:23,236
Mutated.

511
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:27,157
And that if it spread...

512
01:20:27,324 --> 01:20:30,368
it would destroy humanity
for good this time.

513
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:33,079
Not by killing us...

514
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:37,667
but by robbing us of those
things that make us human.

515
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,878
Our speech,
our higher thinking...

516
01:20:40,504 --> 01:20:42,547
It would turn us
into beasts.

517
01:20:42,714 --> 01:20:44,758
You talk about mercy?

518
01:20:46,927 --> 01:20:48,845
What would you have done?

519
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:54,226
It was a moment
of clarity for me.

520
01:20:54,935 --> 01:20:56,102
I realized...

521
01:20:56,269 --> 01:20:59,314
that I would have to
sacrifice my only son...

522
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:02,484
so that humanity
could be saved.

523
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:07,072
I held that gun in my hand...

524
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:09,783
for a long time.

525
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:18,041
I pointed it
at my only child...

526
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:22,504
he looked at me...

527
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:25,674
trust in his eyes.

528
01:21:28,677 --> 01:21:31,638
Even in his primitive gaze...

529
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:39,229
I felt his... love.

530
01:21:46,361 --> 01:21:48,405
I pulled the trigger.

531
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:51,950
It purified me.

532
01:21:53,994 --> 01:21:56,371
It made my purpose clear.

533
01:21:58,164 --> 01:22:00,959
I gave the orders
to kill the other infected.

534
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:02,210
All of them.

535
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:04,671
Burn their belongings...

536
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:07,132
and anything that might
spread contamination.

537
01:22:07,299 --> 01:22:09,884
Some of the men
questioned my judgment.

538
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:12,679
I was asking them to do
what I had done.

539
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:15,140
Sacrifice their friends...

540
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:17,559
their family.

541
01:22:20,645 --> 01:22:22,397
Of course, they refused.

542
01:22:25,483 --> 01:22:27,152
So I had them killed too.

543
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:32,032
Others with children...

544
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:34,326
deserted into the woods.

545
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:39,414
One of those cowards fled
to my superiors up North.

546
01:22:39,581 --> 01:22:40,999
They tried to convince me

547
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:43,960
this plague could be
dealt with medically.

548
01:22:44,586 --> 01:22:48,423
That's when I realized that
they had learned nothing...

549
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,675
from our past.

550
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:54,471
You killed them too?

551
01:22:56,765 --> 01:22:58,683
What did I do, Preacher?

552
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:01,519
You severed their heads, sir.

553
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:05,148
Except for the one I spared...

554
01:23:05,315 --> 01:23:07,984
so that he could return,
and deliver a message.

555
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:10,612
If they wanted to
relieve me of my command...

556
01:23:10,779 --> 01:23:13,615
they would have to
meet me here...

557
01:23:13,782 --> 01:23:15,742
and do it themselves.

558
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:17,702
This used to be
a weapons depot.

559
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:20,664
They turned it
into a relocation camp

560
01:23:20,747 --> 01:23:23,208
when the crisis
was just beginning.

561
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:25,877
But the weapons
are still here...

562
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:28,004
inside the mountain.

563
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:29,673
How many men...

564
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:31,466
will be coming?

565
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:34,803
Probably all of them.
But don't get any ideas.

566
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:38,390
The only thing they fear more
than me is you apes.

567
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:49,234
This is... a holy war.

568
01:23:50,777 --> 01:23:54,531
All of human history
has led to this moment.

569
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,242
If we lose...

570
01:23:58,034 --> 01:24:00,412
we'll be the last
of our kind.

571
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:03,123
It will be a planet of apes.

572
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:06,751
And we will become
your cattle.

573
01:24:08,837 --> 01:24:10,797
Look at you.

574
01:24:11,214 --> 01:24:13,633
You think I'm sick,
don't you?

575
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:24,811
I didn't mean
to kill your son.

576
01:24:26,688 --> 01:24:30,567
But if his destiny was to
inherit your unholy kingdom...

577
01:24:32,402 --> 01:24:34,404
I'm glad I did it.

578
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:36,114
Hey! Hey!

579
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:38,199
Get back!
Donkey, hold him!

580
01:24:38,742 --> 01:24:40,869
Hey!

581
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:48,877
So emotional!

582
01:24:56,217 --> 01:24:58,803
I can see
how conflicted you are.

583
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,016
You're confused
in your purpose.

584
01:25:03,183 --> 01:25:05,435
You are angry at me
for something I did

585
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:08,062
that was an act of war.

586
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:12,984
But you're taking this all
much too personally.

587
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:16,946
What do you think...

588
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:21,701
my men would have done to your
apes if you had killed me?

589
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:25,497
Or is killing me
more important?

590
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:39,928
Soldiers everywhere!

591
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:41,554
How will we get in?

592
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:45,016
Must get in somehow...

593
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:46,935
Must get in!

594
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:50,021
In? In?

595
01:25:51,064 --> 01:25:52,065
No!

596
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:54,901
No go in! No...

597
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:04,911
Friends, friends!

598
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,579
No, no go in.

599
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,081
No go in...

600
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:14,379
Friend! Friend!

601
01:26:18,091 --> 01:26:20,552
Thank you, friend.

602
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:09,350
You saved our lives!

603
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:52,602
Sick humans...

604
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:55,521
must have escaped down here!

605
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,153
No! No! No!

606
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,864
No! No climb!

607
01:28:18,753 --> 01:28:19,753
What?

608
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:21,714
What you see?

609
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:30,556
Wonder where we are?

610
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:57,417
Oh, no, friend!

611
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:00,128
Oh...

612
01:29:01,212 --> 01:29:02,212
No!

613
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:04,590
No!

614
01:29:05,758 --> 01:29:07,468
No! No!

615
01:29:07,635 --> 01:29:09,262
No! Come! Come!

616
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:16,060
Come! Come back! Come!

617
01:29:17,103 --> 01:29:18,271
No, come!

618
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:21,941
Come! Come! Come!

619
01:29:53,264 --> 01:29:54,640
Koba!

620
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:01,314
Sleep.

621
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:05,026
You cannot save them.

622
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:10,323
Apes all die here.

623
01:30:13,326 --> 01:30:14,660
No!

624
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:15,995
Yes.

625
01:30:17,997 --> 01:30:20,333
Join me.

626
01:30:36,641 --> 01:30:39,018
If he's still alive
in the morning...

627
01:30:44,649 --> 01:30:47,527
he goes to work
like everyone else...

628
01:30:48,486 --> 01:30:50,488
or you shoot him.

629
01:30:50,655 --> 01:30:53,741
Come! Come, come.

630
01:30:57,036 --> 01:30:58,871
She go in!

631
01:32:06,564 --> 01:32:08,524
Thirsty...?

632
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:26,287
Hide!

633
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:27,955
Quick!

634
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:40,343
Humans will kill her!

635
01:34:41,802 --> 01:34:44,096
I know what to do! Go!

636
01:34:53,064 --> 01:34:55,274
Arms up! Hey! Hey!

637
01:34:55,441 --> 01:34:56,984
- Arms up!
- Watch it! Watch it!

638
01:35:00,654 --> 01:35:01,655
Let's go!

639
01:35:03,783 --> 01:35:04,992
Keep 'em up!

640
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:10,581
Follow him down.

641
01:35:14,794 --> 01:35:15,794
Keep them up!

642
01:36:17,398 --> 01:36:19,191
Are there others out there?

643
01:36:27,032 --> 01:36:28,367
Sweep the area.

644
01:36:29,535 --> 01:36:30,661
Put him in the pen.

645
01:37:14,288 --> 01:37:17,833
Feeling better?

646
01:37:23,047 --> 01:37:24,047
Good.

647
01:37:24,131 --> 01:37:25,841
Then we can talk about...

648
01:37:26,634 --> 01:37:28,177
Escape.

649
01:37:29,094 --> 01:37:31,055
Apes together strong!

650
01:37:40,231 --> 01:37:41,440
We are the beginning!

651
01:37:41,607 --> 01:37:42,775
And the end!

652
01:38:06,632 --> 01:38:08,300
Still alive.

653
01:38:39,915 --> 01:38:41,333
Send him to the quarry.
Alone.

654
01:38:45,254 --> 01:38:46,422
Hold on.

655
01:39:05,524 --> 01:39:06,859
What is this?

656
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:12,698
How did this get in there?

657
01:39:16,035 --> 01:39:17,202
Get him to work.

658
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:32,676
Thirty-seven.

659
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:44,563
Fifty-five.

660
01:39:47,024 --> 01:39:49,234
Thirty-seven steps to the adult cage...

661
01:39:49,652 --> 01:39:51,737
Fifty-five to the children.

662
01:40:30,693 --> 01:40:32,403
You know...

663
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:34,363
Kerna shoot apes...

664
01:40:34,905 --> 01:40:36,407
when war is done.

665
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:43,122
His war is madness.

666
01:40:44,289 --> 01:40:45,708
It won't save him...

667
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:49,795
any more than
it will save you.

668
01:40:49,962 --> 01:40:51,755
I save myself.

669
01:40:52,965 --> 01:40:58,387
Is there anything
left of you to save?

670
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:21,618
I do.

671
01:41:39,219 --> 01:41:40,804
Apes going back to the cage?

672
01:41:44,725 --> 01:41:46,143
You...

673
01:41:46,852 --> 01:41:47,978
Are very brave.

674
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:50,647
Brave?

675
01:41:50,898 --> 01:41:52,024
Brave!

676
01:41:52,733 --> 01:41:54,193
Brave!

677
01:41:59,198 --> 01:42:00,365
Ape?

678
01:42:02,701 --> 01:42:03,702
Me...?

679
01:42:03,994 --> 01:42:05,537
Ape?

680
01:42:13,378 --> 01:42:14,713
You are...

681
01:42:27,142 --> 01:42:28,977
Nova.

682
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:32,397
Nova.

683
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:45,744
Come! Come!
Come see!

684
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:47,079
Come see!

685
01:42:47,913 --> 01:42:50,415
Come! Come see!

686
01:43:05,389 --> 01:43:08,100
34, 35, 36, 37...

687
01:43:09,268 --> 01:43:10,269
37!

688
01:43:12,688 --> 01:43:14,022
I do.

689
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:17,776
What now?

690
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:27,410
What?

691
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:35,794
Oh, no!

692
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:37,629
Oh, no!

693
01:43:38,630 --> 01:43:39,923
No, no!

694
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:41,300
No, no, no...

695
01:43:46,763 --> 01:43:48,056
Okay.

696
01:44:54,039 --> 01:44:56,625
This is the ape I told you about!

697
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:00,420
Thank you.

698
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:18,981
Bad Ape.

699
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:40,710
What's wrong?

700
01:46:00,605 --> 01:46:01,732
We can't keep digging!

701
01:46:02,065 --> 01:46:04,234
It will flood the whole tunnel!

702
01:46:04,484 --> 01:46:07,279
If we don't, we can't reach the children!

703
01:46:26,965 --> 01:46:28,633
We must keep looking down there...

704
01:46:28,967 --> 01:46:30,802
Find another way to reach the children...

705
01:46:31,178 --> 01:46:32,929
We must leave now!

706
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:34,639
More soldiers are coming!

707
01:46:35,098 --> 01:46:36,641
Humans will destroy each other!

708
01:46:37,059 --> 01:46:38,935
And us with them!

709
01:46:43,607 --> 01:46:45,527
We'll have to get the
children out above ground!

710
01:46:46,318 --> 01:46:47,444
How...?

711
01:47:21,603 --> 01:47:22,604
Hey!

712
01:47:24,106 --> 01:47:25,440
You animals!

713
01:47:45,877 --> 01:47:46,962
Who did that?

714
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:49,464
Who did that?

715
01:47:51,216 --> 01:47:52,342
Huh?

716
01:47:54,052 --> 01:47:55,387
Who was it?

717
01:48:03,395 --> 01:48:04,646
Was it you?

718
01:49:57,425 --> 01:49:58,843
I love you, son.

719
01:51:08,747 --> 01:51:10,582
Go, go, go.

720
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:29,768
Hurry! Let's go!

721
01:51:34,773 --> 01:51:36,608
Caesar, what's wrong?

722
01:51:47,243 --> 01:51:48,870
Hurry, you must go.

723
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:51,790
Without you?

724
01:51:52,415 --> 01:51:54,125
No...

725
01:51:54,209 --> 01:51:55,919
Maurice was right.

726
01:52:00,799 --> 01:52:02,425
I am...

727
01:52:03,426 --> 01:52:04,719
like Koba.

728
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:06,888
He could not...

729
01:52:08,056 --> 01:52:09,933
escape his hate.

730
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:18,316
And I still cannot
escape mine.

731
01:52:24,781 --> 01:52:26,324
Go, go, go.

732
01:52:28,743 --> 01:52:29,744
Fire!

733
01:53:13,121 --> 01:53:15,457
Colonel! Colonel!

734
01:53:17,876 --> 01:53:19,294
Where the hell is he?

735
01:53:53,036 --> 01:53:55,413
Down! Down! Down!

736
01:53:56,915 --> 01:53:58,082
Get down!

737
01:58:12,962 --> 01:58:14,505
Take him out!

738
01:58:26,142 --> 01:58:28,269
Come on, donkey.
Let's go! Reload!

739
01:59:03,805 --> 01:59:06,307
Colonel,
are you in there? Colonel!

740
01:59:06,974 --> 01:59:08,518
Just break it down.

741
01:59:48,599 --> 01:59:49,599
Donkey!

742
01:59:50,351 --> 01:59:51,727
Grenade launcher!

743
02:00:48,951 --> 02:00:51,996
God damn it, donkey!
Get me the launcher!

744
02:05:01,036 --> 02:05:04,081
Oh, no! Oh, no!

745
02:05:04,248 --> 02:05:06,208
Oh, no! Oh, no!

746
02:09:11,745 --> 02:09:13,414
Don't worry.

747
02:09:18,001 --> 02:09:19,420
Maurice.

748
02:09:23,257 --> 02:09:27,761
You are all home now.

749
02:09:31,598 --> 02:09:33,809
Apes are strong.

750
02:09:37,855 --> 02:09:39,148
With...

751
02:09:40,357 --> 02:09:42,192
or without me.

752
02:10:09,344 --> 02:10:11,054
Son...

753
02:10:13,557 --> 02:10:15,559
will know...

754
02:10:17,019 --> 02:10:18,395
who...

755
02:10:19,646 --> 02:10:21,064
was...

756
02:10:22,357 --> 02:10:23,692
father.

757
02:10:34,661 --> 02:10:36,246
And what...

758
02:10:38,415 --> 02:10:39,917
Caesar...

759
02:10:43,086 --> 02:10:44,379
did...

760
02:10:45,839 --> 02:10:47,341
