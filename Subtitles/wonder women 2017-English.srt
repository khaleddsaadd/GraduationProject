<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

3
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:52,236
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

4
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:56,067
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

5
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:00,663
<i>It is a land of
magic and wonder.</i>

6
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:04,227
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

7
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:08,432
<i>But the closer you get...</i>

8
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,226
<i>...the more you see the great
darkness shimmering within.</i>

9
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,882
<i>And mankind?</i>

10
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:23,971
<i>Mankind is another
story altogether.</i>

11
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:31,141
<i>What one does when faced with truth..
is more difficult than you think.</i>

12
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:43,187
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

13
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:46,276
<i>A long long time ago.</i>

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,201
<i>And now...</i>

15
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,702
<i>...I will never be the same.</i>

16
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,411
Yeah.. si.

19
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:51,570
Hello, Diana.

20
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,501
<i>- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.</i>

21
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:55,397
<i>Diana!</i>

22
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:57,833
Diana!

23
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,445
Come back!

24
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,838
- She looks very good.
- Very good.

25
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,888
How is she?

26
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,183
She's good.

27
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:44,692
- Keep working.
- I will.

28
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:47,722
Niobi.

29
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,334
Diana!

30
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,442
Diana, I see you.

31
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:21,634
Where are you going?
Slow down!

32
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:33,742
Hello mother.

33
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:35,844
How are you today?

34
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,964
Let's get you back to school,
before another tutor quits.

35
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:43,551
But don't you think it's time
to start my training?

36
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:46,010
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

37
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,076
Does she?

38
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,279
I could begin showing
her some things.

39
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:55,245
She should at least be
able to defend herself.

40
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:56,585
From whom?

41
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,667
In the event of an invasion.

42
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:02,169
Isn't that why I have the greatest
warrior in our history...

43
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,672
...leading an entire army,
General?

44
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:08,837
I pray day will never come
when she has to fight.

45
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:12,112
But you know, a
scorpion must sting...

46
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:14,796
- A wolf must hunt...
- She is a child.

47
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:17,385
The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.

48
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,431
But, mother...

49
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:19,829
There will be no training.

50
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,077
What if I promise to be careful?

51
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,909
It's time to sleep.

52
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:35,906
What if I didn't use a sword?

53
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:38,808
Fighting does not
make you a hero.

54
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,733
Just the shield then,
no sharp edges.

55
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:46,004
Diana, you are the most precious
thing in the world to me.

56
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:50,898
I wished for you so much, so I
sculpted you from clay myself.

57
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:53,664
...and begged Zeus
to give you life.

58
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,498
You've told me this story.

59
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:59,614
Which is why.. tonight
I'll tell you a new one.

60
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:03,426
The story of our people
and my days of battle.

61
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:04,666
Yes!

62
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,700
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

63
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,275
<i>Long ago, when time was new...</i>

64
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:20,905
<i>...and all of history
was still a dream...</i>

65
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:23,408
<i>...the gods ruled the earth.</i>

66
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,242
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

67
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:32,017
<i>Zeus created beings over
which the Gods would ruled.</i>

68
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:35,065
<i>Beings born in his image...</i>

69
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,927
<i>...fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

70
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:43,758
<i>He called his creation "Man".
And mankind was good.</i>

71
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:47,964
<i>But Zeus' son.. grew
envious of mankind...</i>

72
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:51,331
<i>...and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.</i>

73
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:55,806
<i>This was Ares,
the God of War.</i>

74
00:06:58,013 --> 00:07:02,177
<i>Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.</i>

75
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:04,471
<i>He turned them against
one another...</i>

76
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:07,666
<i>...and the war ravaged the Earth.</i>

77
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:12,782
<i>So, the gods created
us, the Amazons...</i>

78
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:15,431
<i>...to influence men's
hearts with love...</i>

79
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:18,130
<i>...and restore
peace to the Earth.</i>

80
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:24,255
<i>And for a brief time,
there was peace.</i>

81
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:31,579
<i>But it did not last.</i>

82
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:42,073
<i>Your mother, The Amazon
Queen, led a revolt...</i>

83
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:45,176
<i>...that freed us all
from enslavement.</i>

84
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:55,474
<i>When Zeus led the gods
to our defence...</i>

85
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:58,807
<i>...Ares killed
them one by one...</i>

86
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,163
<i>...until only Zeus
himself remained.</i>

87
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:07,952
<i>Zeus used the last of his
power to stop Ares...</i>

88
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:13,497
<i>...striking such a blow, the god
of war was forced to retreat.</i>

89
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:15,894
<i>But Zeus knew...</i>

90
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,233
<i>...that one day Ares might
return to finish his mission.</i>

91
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:22,169
<i>An endless war...</i>

92
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:26,434
<i>...where mankind would finally
destroy themselves...</i>

93
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:29,326
<i>...and us with them.</i>

94
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:32,028
<i>So Zeus left us a weapon.</i>

95
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,327
<i>...One powerful
enough to kill a god.</i>

96
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,547
<i>With his dying breath, Zeus
created this island...</i>

97
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,721
<i>to hide us from
the outside world...</i>

98
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:45,344
<i>...Somewhere Ares
could not find us.</i>

99
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,125
<i>And all has been
quiet ever since.</i>

100
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:03,983
We give thanks to the gods
for giving us this paradise.

101
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,411
And the God Killer?

102
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:13,214
The God Killer?

103
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,930
The weapon that is strong
enough to kill a God.

104
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,254
Can I see it?

105
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:30,244
The gods gave us many gifts.

106
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,445
One day, you'll know them all.

107
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,960
This great tower is
where we keep them.

108
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:49,622
The God Killer.

109
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,869
It's beautiful.

110
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:57,827
Who would be wield it?

111
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,981
I pray it will never
be called to arms.

112
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:06,671
But only the fiercest
among us even could.

113
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:09,083
And that's not you, Diana.

114
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:12,286
You see?
You are safe...

115
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:15,708
...and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.

116
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:30,981
You keep doubting
yourself, Diana.

117
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:33,410
- No, I don't.
- Yes. You do.

118
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:35,066
No, I don't.

119
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,751
You're stronger than you believe.
You have greater powers than you know.

120
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,761
- But if you don't try harder...
- Diana!

121
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:58,604
Are you hurt?

122
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,974
No, Mother, I'm fine.

123
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,007
- I was just...
- Training.

124
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:05,929
Seems I'm not the
revered queen I should be.

125
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,449
Disobeyed, betrayed
by my own sister...

126
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,800
No, mother. It was me.
I asked her...

127
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,062
Take her to the palace.

128
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:15,350
Off you go.

129
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:25,715
You left me no
choice, Hippolyta.

130
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:30,051
You neglect your duty,
if she cannot fight.

131
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:32,388
You speak of a time
that may never come.

132
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:38,494
He might never return.
He could have died from his wounds.

133
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,406
Ares is alive.

134
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:45,111
You feel it as I do,
in your bones.

135
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:48,190
It is only a matter of
time before he returns.

136
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:55,992
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he will find her.

137
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,881
Hippolyta,
I love her as you do.

138
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:03,427
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

139
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:17,824
You will train her harder
than any Amazon before her.

140
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,237
Five times harder...

141
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,619
...ten times harder.

142
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,722
Until she's better
than even you.

143
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,125
But she must never
know the truth...

144
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,782
about what she is...

145
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,530
...or how she came to be.

146
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:28,186
Harder.

147
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,344
You are stronger
than this, Diana.

148
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,386
Again.

149
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:51,215
Never let your guard down.

150
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,052
You expect the battle to be fair.

151
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,814
A battle will never be fair.

152
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:10,834
Anti­ope!

153
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:13,749
Lay still..

154
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,276
You're bleeding.

155
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:18,778
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana.

156
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,251
What had I done?

157
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,525
I am sorry.

158
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,796
Where did this fog come from?

159
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:09,417
There...
Go forward.

160
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:27,250
<i>There he is!</i>

161
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:28,330
<i>The pilot! I can see him.</i>

162
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,002
Wow.

163
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,310
You are a man.

164
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,527
Yeah. I mean...

165
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,217
Do I not look like one?

166
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,953
Where are we?

167
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,945
Temiscira.

168
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:26,377
What?

169
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:27,952
Who are you?

170
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,942
I'm one of the good guys and
those are the bad guys.

171
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:40,148
What?

172
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:42,104
The German.
Come on, we need to get out of here.

173
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:44,051
- The Germans?
- Diana!

174
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,817
Step away from her now.

175
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:50,898
Ready your bows!

176
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:55,311
They have guns.
Right?

177
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,197
Fire!

178
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:01,537
Come on!

179
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,361
Stay down!

180
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:20,071
Shield!

181
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:41,834
No!

182
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:43,942
No!

183
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,711
No.

184
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,721
No. No.. Antiope.

185
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,474
Anti­ope, hey.

186
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:02,319
Diana.

187
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:06,005
- The time has come.
- No.

188
00:22:06,903 --> 00:22:08,944
You... you must...

189
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:12,240
What? What, Anti­ope?

190
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,477
God Killer!

191
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,207
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

192
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,195
- Where?
- Go...

193
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,624
Please no.
No, no!

194
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,010
- No!
- Anti­ope!

195
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:32,975
No!

196
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:41,825
- You.
- No..

197
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,255
No mother no.

198
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,798
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

199
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,235
What man fights against
his own people?

200
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,153
These aren't my people.

201
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,488
Then, why do you
wear their colors?

202
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:54,546
I can't tell you that.

203
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,888
You need to tell us now!

204
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:56,914
What's your name?

205
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,676
I can't tell you that either.

206
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:03,524
We should kill him now
and be done with it.

207
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,851
If he dies...

208
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,401
...we know nothing about who
they are and why they came.

209
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:18,405
My...

210
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:24,785
name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot,
American Expeditionary Forces.

211
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,027
Serial number 8141921.

212
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:29,213
That's all I ever need to...

213
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:36,935
Assigned to British
Intelligence.

214
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,446
What the hell is this thing?

215
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:43,448
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

216
00:23:43,826 --> 00:23:45,345
But it's really hot.

217
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,351
It is pointless and
painful to resist.

218
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,697
What is your mission?

219
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:54,560
Whoever you are, you are in more danger
than you think.

220
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,100
What is your mission?

221
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,230
I am a...

222
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:05,929
I am a...

223
00:24:09,437 --> 00:24:10,940
I'm a spy.

224
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,384
I'm a spy.
I'm a spy.

225
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:20,321
British Intelligence got word...

226
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:23,393
...that the leader of the
German Army Gen. Ludendorff.

227
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,443
...would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman empire.

228
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,542
I posed as one of their
pilots and flew in with them.

229
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,361
According to our Intel, the
Germans had no troops left...

230
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:37,206
...no money, no
munitions of any kind.

231
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:41,970
But our Intel was wrong. The German
had the Turks building bombs for them.

232
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:44,313
And not just bombs, new weapons.

233
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:45,922
Secret weapons.

234
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:52,665
Invented by Ludendorff's chief
psychopath, Dr. Isabelle Maru.

235
00:24:53,736 --> 00:24:57,002
The boys in the trenches
called her "Doctor Poison".

236
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:59,414
And for good reason.

237
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:32,005
From what I could tell if Dr Maru
was able to complete her work,

238
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:35,426
...millions more would die.
The war would never end.

239
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,588
I was there to observe and
report, nothing more...

240
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:40,834
...but, I had
to do something.

241
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:52,573
<i>I just.. I need more time.</i>

242
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,345
Unfortunately,
Dr. we don't have more time.

243
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,835
This work, this...

244
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:04,088
Get that man!

245
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,177
Now!

246
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:01,916
If I can get these notes back to
the British Intelligence in time...

247
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:05,232
...it could stop
millions more from dying.

248
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,732
It could stop the war.

249
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:10,423
War? What war?

250
00:27:12,295 --> 00:27:14,128
The War.

251
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:19,501
The war to end the all wars.

252
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,010
Four years...

253
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,697
27 countries...

254
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:26,484
25 million dead...

255
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:29,199
...Soldiers and civilians.

256
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,757
Innocent people...

257
00:27:32,437 --> 00:27:34,671
...Women and
children slaughtered.

258
00:27:35,874 --> 00:27:39,258
Their homes and thier villages
looted & burned.

259
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:46,201
Weapons far deadlier
than you can...

260
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:50,142
...ever imagine.

261
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:56,616
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

262
00:27:57,647 --> 00:27:59,754
It's like the world's gonna end.

263
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,873
Should we let him go?

264
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:05,977
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

265
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:08,050
We can not hold him
forever, my queen.

266
00:28:08,075 --> 00:28:10,022
Mother, excuse me...

267
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:14,305
...but after everything the
man said, this must be Ares.

268
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,628
What are you talking
about, child?

269
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:19,100
Forgive me, Senator, but the man
called it a war without end.

270
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:21,848
Millions of people already dead.

271
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:24,789
Like nothing he's ever seen.

272
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:26,728
Only Ares could do such a thing.

273
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:32,022
We can not simply let him go.
We must go with him.

274
00:28:32,495 --> 00:28:35,010
I will not deploy our army and
leave them scare defences...

275
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:36,412
...to go and fight their war.

276
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,332
It's not their war.

277
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:41,586
Zeus created man to be just, and
wise, strong and passionate...

278
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:44,002
That was a story, Diana!

279
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:45,688
This much, you
do not understand?

280
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:46,690
Men are easily corrupted.

281
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:49,225
Yes, but Ares is behind
that corruption!

282
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:53,037
It is Ares who has these
Germans fighting..

283
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,809
And stopping the God of war
is our fore ordinance.

284
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:59,418
As Amazons this is our duty.

285
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:02,874
But you're not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

286
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:04,810
So you will do nothing.

287
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,978
As your queen I forbid it.

288
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,264
Strange.

289
00:29:22,897 --> 00:29:24,785
Is it true you saved his life?

290
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,492
Who told you that?

291
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:27,842
He did.

292
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:55,335
Ah.. I didn't see you come in.

293
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:04,196
Would you say you are a...

294
00:30:05,158 --> 00:30:07,857
...a typical example
of your sex?

295
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:10,378
I am...

296
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,643
...above average.

297
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,616
What's that?

298
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,916
It's a...

299
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,024
Oh...

300
00:30:28,906 --> 00:30:29,907
It's a watch.

301
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:31,730
A watch?

302
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:33,102
Yeah, it's a watch.

303
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,737
Tells time.

304
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,275
My father gave it to me.

305
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:40,469
Went through hell 'n back with him.

306
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:44,833
Now it's for me and,
good thing it's still ticking..

307
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:46,955
What for?

308
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:50,497
Because it tells time.

309
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,377
When to eat, sleep,
wake up, work...

310
00:30:55,908 --> 00:30:58,877
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

311
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,643
Yeah...

312
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:08,549
Can I ask you some questions?

313
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:11,792
- Where are we?
- Temiscira.

314
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:15,573
No, I got that before, but I mean..
Where are we?

315
00:31:16,484 --> 00:31:17,860
What is this place?
Who are you people?

316
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:20,334
Why does the water do that?

317
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,768
How come you don't know what a watch is?
How can you speak English so well?

318
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:25,212
We speak hundreds of languages.

319
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:29,161
We are the bridge to a greater
understanding between all men.

320
00:31:31,408 --> 00:31:32,421
Right.

321
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:39,112
I didn't get a chance
to say this...

322
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:44,774
...earlier, but thank you for
dragging me out of the water.

323
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:47,584
Thank you...

324
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,513
...for what you
did on the beach.

325
00:31:58,489 --> 00:31:59,490
So...

326
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:02,311
...you are here to let me go?

327
00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:07,179
I tried, but it's not up to me.

328
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,265
I even asked them to
send me with you..

329
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:13,257
Or anyone.

330
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:14,619
In Amazon..

331
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,670
The Amazons.

332
00:32:16,723 --> 00:32:17,880
The Amazons?

333
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:20,781
It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.

334
00:32:21,877 --> 00:32:23,663
And I wish to go..

335
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:28,492
But my mother will not allow it.

336
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:31,966
Well...

337
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:34,854
I can't say I blame her.

338
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,056
The way this war's going...

339
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:39,557
...I don't wanna let
anyone I care about near.

340
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,018
Then why do you want to go back?

341
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,665
I don't think "want"
is the word, right?

342
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:49,020
I guess I gotta try.

343
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:52,973
My father told me
once he said...

344
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:55,496
" If you see something wrong
happening in the world...

345
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:58,319
"... you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

346
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:01,993
And I already tried nothing.

347
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,153
Nice outfit.

348
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:44,026
Oh, thank you.

349
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,875
Now.. I'll show you the
way off the Island...

350
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:50,205
...and you'll take me to Ares.

351
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:52,306
Deal.

352
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,489
I am leaving on that?

353
00:36:02,673 --> 00:36:03,996
We are..

354
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,367
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

355
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:08,969
Do you not know how to sail?

356
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:10,428
Of course I know how to sail.

357
00:36:10,456 --> 00:36:12,418
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

358
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:14,888
It's been a while.

359
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,485
I am going, mother.

360
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:49,482
I cannot stand by while
innocent lives are lost.

361
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,871
If no one else will defend the
world from Ares, then I must.

362
00:36:56,473 --> 00:36:57,902
I have to go.

363
00:36:58,279 --> 00:36:59,401
I know.

364
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,878
Or at least I know I
can not stop you.

365
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:10,203
There is so much...

366
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:12,280
So much you do not understand.

367
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:14,489
I understand enough.

368
00:37:14,514 --> 00:37:17,849
But I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

369
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:22,130
Like you once did.

370
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:24,738
You know that if you
choose to leave...

371
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:27,956
...you may never return.

372
00:37:29,744 --> 00:37:31,728
Who will I be if I stay?

373
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:43,657
This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history...

374
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,593
...our beloved Anti­ope.

375
00:37:46,618 --> 00:37:48,691
Make sure you're worthy of it.

376
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,851
I will.

377
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:57,322
Be careful in the
world of men, Diana.

378
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:01,432
They do not deserve you.

379
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:08,819
You've been my greatest love.

380
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:14,264
Today...

381
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:18,945
...you are my greatest sorrow.

382
00:38:57,363 --> 00:38:58,716
Should you have told her?

383
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:03,932
The more she knows, the
sooner he will find her.

384
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:17,290
How long until we reach the war?

385
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,625
The war, which part?

386
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:22,461
The Western Front in France is...

387
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,864
...400 miles long, from the
Alps to the North Sea.

388
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,405
Where the fighting is
the most intense then.

389
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:31,459
If you take me there, I'm
sure I'll find Ares.

390
00:39:35,184 --> 00:39:37,415
Ares as in..
the God of War?

391
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,516
The God of war is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

392
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:44,428
With this.

393
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:47,183
And once I do...

394
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:49,344
...the war will end.

395
00:39:56,455 --> 00:39:58,632
Look. I appreciate your spirit...

396
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,224
...but this war is...

397
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:03,583
It's a great big mess.

398
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:07,201
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

399
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:10,118
I mean, we can get back to London
and try to look for men who can.

400
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:11,929
I'm the man who can!

401
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:14,149
Once I find and destroy Ares...

402
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:17,026
...the German armies will be
freed from his influence...

403
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,212
...they will good men again
and the world will be better.

404
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:25,843
Great.

405
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:27,580
You will see.

406
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:31,967
What are you doing?

407
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:35,111
I thought maybe you wanna...

408
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:37,315
...get some sleep.

409
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:43,186
What about you?
Are you not sleeping?

410
00:40:43,453 --> 00:40:45,279
Does the average men not sleep?

411
00:40:49,303 --> 00:40:52,326
Yes, we sleep. We just
don't sleep with a...

412
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:53,613
You don't sleep with women?

413
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,676
No, I mean, I do, I sleep with...
I sleep with...

414
00:40:58,113 --> 00:40:59,469
Yes, I do..

415
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:01,106
But out of the...

416
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:05,220
...confines of marriage.

417
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:10,779
Not polite to assume, you know?

418
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:16,127
"Marriage"?

419
00:41:16,128 --> 00:41:18,012
Marriage! You don't have...

420
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:20,661
You go before a judge...

421
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:25,168
...and you swear to love, honor
and cherish each other...

422
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:26,370
...Until death do you apart.

423
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:29,192
And do they.. love
each other till death?

424
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:31,309
Not very often, no.

425
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,761
Then why do they do it?

426
00:41:32,786 --> 00:41:35,367
I have no idea.

427
00:41:36,948 --> 00:41:39,194
So you cannot sleep
with me unless I marry you..

428
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:41,021
I sleep with you if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

429
00:41:41,046 --> 00:41:42,121
There is plenty of room.

430
00:41:42,447 --> 00:41:44,713
- Then fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

431
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:47,548
- I'm just fine.
- Coming to sleep with you.

432
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:48,758
Okay.

433
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:14,963
You know, where I come from, I'm
not considered average.

434
00:42:15,778 --> 00:42:18,319
You know, um..
being a spy...

435
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:21,692
you must show a
certain amount of...

436
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:24,541
...vigor.

437
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,208
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

438
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,057
I have no father.

439
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:35,352
My mother sculpted
me from clay...

440
00:42:35,577 --> 00:42:37,768
...and I was brought
to life by Zeus.

441
00:42:40,897 --> 00:42:42,192
Well that's neat.

442
00:42:45,904 --> 00:42:46,905
Sorry.

443
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,397
Where I come from..

444
00:42:52,835 --> 00:42:55,011
...babies are made differently.

445
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:57,908
You refer to
reproductive biology.

446
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:59,626
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

447
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,939
I know all about that.

448
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:05,026
I mean I refer to that
and other things.

449
00:43:05,957 --> 00:43:07,255
The pleasures of the flesh.

450
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,708
Do you know about that?

451
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:16,996
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
criticism on earthly pleasures

452
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,061
12 huh?

453
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,998
Did you bring any
of those with you?

454
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:28,768
You would not enjoy them.

455
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:30,203
I don't know.
May be.

456
00:43:30,419 --> 00:43:31,424
No you wouldn't.

457
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:32,690
Why not?

458
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:36,330
They came to the conclusion that man
are essential for procreation...

459
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,355
...but when it comes
to pleasure...

460
00:43:39,548 --> 00:43:40,553
...Unnecessary.

461
00:43:40,723 --> 00:43:41,724
No.

462
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:48,035
Goodnight.

463
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,416
Goodnight.

464
00:44:01,954 --> 00:44:03,554
How long until we're operational?

465
00:44:03,555 --> 00:44:04,876
Two days, sir.

466
00:44:04,877 --> 00:44:06,759
We'll have it up
tonight, Captain.

467
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:11,104
Sir, the men have had
no food, no sleep.

468
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:13,266
Do you think I have had a
neat food or rest, captain?

469
00:44:13,878 --> 00:44:15,745
Do you hear me making excuses?

470
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,713
No.

471
00:44:16,714 --> 00:44:18,391
Your men, they are
weak, complacent.

472
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:21,389
You've let them forget for an
attack can happen at any time.

473
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:22,922
...from any cover!

474
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,474
So let's you & I remind them...

475
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:25,662
...Shall we?

476
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,116
- Doctor.
- General.

477
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,347
Progress?

478
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:44,776
Not enough.

479
00:44:45,588 --> 00:44:47,419
It is over, General.

480
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,504
Germany is giving up.

481
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:53,598
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice.

482
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:55,888
We have run out of time.

483
00:44:57,531 --> 00:45:00,243
As soon as the Kaiser sees
the newest weapon...

484
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:02,215
...he will not
sign the armistice.

485
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:03,403
But without my notebook...

486
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,988
We will get your book!

487
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:07,500
It is you that I believe in,
not it.

488
00:45:08,924 --> 00:45:11,980
I know what you can
and will succeed...

489
00:45:13,768 --> 00:45:17,057
It is what you're put
on this earth to do.

490
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:24,038
Something, it come
to me last night.

491
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:26,263
A different type of gas.

492
00:45:27,194 --> 00:45:28,398
For you.

493
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:30,849
To restore your strength.

494
00:46:00,962 --> 00:46:03,625
I have got it!
I have got it!

495
00:46:03,914 --> 00:46:06,878
And if it's what I think...

496
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,045
It's going to be...

497
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:13,062
...terrible.

498
00:46:34,155 --> 00:46:35,629
Morning!

499
00:46:36,022 --> 00:46:38,719
We got lucky. We caught a
ride, we make some good time.

500
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,005
Welcome to Jolly old London!

501
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:42,933
It's hideous..

502
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,946
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

503
00:47:07,253 --> 00:47:08,870
- Good morning Darling.
- What a babe.

504
00:47:09,123 --> 00:47:10,124
Oh no!

505
00:47:10,145 --> 00:47:12,614
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

506
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,439
Come on!

507
00:47:18,023 --> 00:47:19,556
Why are they holding hands?

508
00:47:20,496 --> 00:47:22,679
Probably because
they're together.

509
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:28,065
No... No.. We're not together,
I mean, in that way.

510
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,351
This way.

511
00:47:29,451 --> 00:47:30,452
To the war!

512
00:47:30,693 --> 00:47:33,295
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta get this way first.

513
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,796
And where are we going?

514
00:47:35,117 --> 00:47:36,788
We gotta get this
notebook to my superiors.

515
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,109
Hey! Hey..!

516
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,281
No. I let you go.
You take me to Ares.

517
00:47:41,547 --> 00:47:43,279
- We made a deal, Steve Trevor.
- Yeah.

518
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,742
And a deal is a promise.

519
00:47:44,984 --> 00:47:46,884
You know promises unbreakable.

520
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,839
Oi, damn it, alright.

521
00:47:50,937 --> 00:47:52,622
Come with me first
to deliver this...

522
00:47:52,918 --> 00:47:54,479
...and then we'll
give you a ticket...

523
00:47:55,496 --> 00:47:56,497
...to the war.

524
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,781
Deal?

525
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:00,415
- Let's go.
- Diana...

526
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:01,416
What are you doing?

527
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:03,881
You can not do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

528
00:48:03,906 --> 00:48:07,117
Let's go... Let's go
buy some clothes.

529
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:09,322
What do these women
wear into battle?

530
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:10,699
They don't...

531
00:48:11,508 --> 00:48:12,562
A baby!

532
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,058
No, no.. No babies.

533
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,941
One's not made out of clay.

534
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:20,305
Come on.

535
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:22,534
Diana! Please.

536
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,189
Thank God! You're not dead!

537
00:48:41,925 --> 00:48:43,493
Hurray!

538
00:48:43,494 --> 00:48:45,827
I did think you're dead till
I got your call, you know?

539
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:48,769
He's been gone for weeks..
Not a single word.

540
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,093
Very unlike him.

541
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:52,549
I am introducing myself.
I'm Etta Candy.

542
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,567
I am Steve Trevor's secretary.

543
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:56,052
What is a secretary?

544
00:48:56,706 --> 00:48:57,707
Well, I do everything.

545
00:48:57,959 --> 00:49:00,361
I go where he tells me to go and
I do what he tells me to do.

546
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:02,861
Where I am from,
that's called slavery.

547
00:49:03,182 --> 00:49:04,134
I really like her.

548
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:05,721
Fantastic.
Ladies after you.

549
00:49:05,722 --> 00:49:06,891
Oh.. I do, I like her.

550
00:49:15,554 --> 00:49:19,308
Is this what persons call
armor in your country?

551
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,207
Ah. well, "Armors".
It's fashion.

552
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:23,840
Keeps our tummies in..

553
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:25,543
Why must you keep them in?

554
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:28,001
Any woman with a tummy
won't ask that question!

555
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:33,215
Conservative, but
not entirely unfun.

556
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:35,764
Try it on at least.

557
00:49:36,124 --> 00:49:37,142
Very well..

558
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:39,532
No!

559
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:47,909
Come on!

560
00:49:57,182 --> 00:49:59,844
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

561
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:01,233
Fight?

562
00:50:01,234 --> 00:50:02,842
We use our principles.

563
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,746
That's the way we are
gonna get to vote.

564
00:50:05,016 --> 00:50:08,627
Although I am not opposed to
engaging in a bitter fist stickups..

565
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:10,552
...should the occasion arise.

566
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:13,212
Lovely.

567
00:50:14,957 --> 00:50:17,176
It's itching.
It's choking me.

568
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:20,528
Can they blame it?

569
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,063
Etta.

570
00:50:22,593 --> 00:50:23,341
Where is she?

571
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,825
She's trying on upto number 226.

572
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:31,249
Resync by AnyiNk for
nonton01.com

573
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:38,738
Ms. Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

574
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:39,978
...distracting.

575
00:50:42,396 --> 00:50:43,507
May I?

576
00:50:48,032 --> 00:50:49,346
Really? Specs?

577
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,722
Unless it's the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?

578
00:50:58,467 --> 00:50:59,661
Better.

579
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,082
Yep, that's not gonna work.

580
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,009
Please put the
sword down, Diana.

581
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:15,262
Diana!

582
00:51:16,483 --> 00:51:17,484
Let me try by myself.

583
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:18,790
After you, sir.

584
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:29,366
Etta...

585
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:32,058
Why don't I meet you
back at the office?

586
00:51:32,308 --> 00:51:34,129
And meanwhile, I'll take
this for safekeeping.

587
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:35,409
Oh no, I don't think so.

588
00:51:35,445 --> 00:51:37,239
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

589
00:51:37,475 --> 00:51:39,247
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- Not at all.

590
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:41,534
Put the sword down,
first of all.

591
00:51:44,124 --> 00:51:47,530
Promise me you'll protect
it with your life.

592
00:51:48,263 --> 00:51:49,936
Yes... no.

593
00:51:50,406 --> 00:51:52,129
You can trust her.
Just hand that over.

594
00:51:52,514 --> 00:51:54,306
- Shield.
- And the shield to her..

595
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:56,770
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

596
00:51:56,795 --> 00:51:58,012
This is easy.

597
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:01,344
There we go.

598
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:30,357
What is it?

599
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,432
Hopefully, nothing.
Come on.

600
00:52:44,157 --> 00:52:46,199
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on!

601
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:57,432
Captain Trevor.

602
00:52:58,357 --> 00:53:01,345
I believe you have something that
is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.

603
00:53:03,106 --> 00:53:05,579
Ah, it's the bad guy convention.

604
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:08,336
Give us Dr Maru's note book.

605
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:10,566
Where I put that thing?

606
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:13,543
Stand back!

607
00:53:24,728 --> 00:53:25,729
Or maybe not.

608
00:53:41,815 --> 00:53:42,816
Tough luck.

609
00:53:49,198 --> 00:53:51,244
Is there anything else
you wanna show me?

610
00:53:52,248 --> 00:53:53,935
Where do you think you're going?

611
00:54:00,677 --> 00:54:03,168
I'm sorry, but you're clearly
under Ares' control.

612
00:54:03,763 --> 00:54:06,076
- Diana.
- Let me help you get free.

613
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:07,776
Where will I find Ares?

614
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,989
He's... He's dead.

615
00:54:18,284 --> 00:54:19,443
Cyanide.

616
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:30,046
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

617
00:54:30,288 --> 00:54:32,921
<i>Come on! Gentlemen, please!</i>

618
00:54:38,404 --> 00:54:39,749
<i>Let him speak!</i>

619
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:41,107
Yes thank you, gentlemen...

620
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:45,756
<i>Germany is an immensely
proud nation.</i>

621
00:54:47,013 --> 00:54:48,914
<i>They will never surrender.</i>

622
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,941
<i>Now look.
The only way to end this war...</i>

623
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:54,493
Colonel, I need to
talk to you outside.

624
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:57,663
<i>...and restore world peace...</i>

625
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,537
<i>is to negotiate...</i>

626
00:55:01,344 --> 00:55:02,927
...an armistice.

627
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,133
<i>There's a woman.</i>

628
00:55:06,123 --> 00:55:07,587
What is she doing here?
Get her out..

629
00:55:09,552 --> 00:55:10,793
Ger her out..

630
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:12,437
Sorry.

631
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:14,940
Blind sister,
she got lost on the way to her bathroom..

632
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:17,119
I think it's right
where I guess.

633
00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:19,801
<i>Our only aim at this time...</i>

634
00:55:19,826 --> 00:55:22,646
<i>...must be to achieve peace...</i>

635
00:55:22,647 --> 00:55:24,650
<i>...at any cost!</i>

636
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,556
Why you been not hearing speech?
He is talking of peace.

637
00:55:30,557 --> 00:55:32,168
Not right now!

638
00:55:37,163 --> 00:55:39,753
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking
bringing a woman into the counsel?

639
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:41,766
The Intel that I brought
back is time sensitive.

640
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:43,461
This is one of Dr.
Maru's notebooks.

641
00:55:43,695 --> 00:55:44,696
Notebook or notes...

642
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,048
We need to get it
to Cryptography.

643
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:47,827
And I need a immediate
audience with the generals.

644
00:55:47,828 --> 00:55:49,910
You do not just barge in here.

645
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:51,678
Sir with all due respect..
What I saw in my ^^...

646
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:52,815
...will change the
course of war.

647
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,406
Captain Trevor!

648
00:55:56,128 --> 00:55:57,854
I heard we lost you in
one of your mission...

649
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,286
...and here you are,
back from the dead...

650
00:55:59,287 --> 00:56:01,237
...and I see you
brought a friend.

651
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:03,028
My deepest apology for
interruption sir.

652
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,697
No, no no... non sense.

653
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:06,665
Thanks to this young woman...

654
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:10,316
...the room was finally quiet enough
for me to get a few words in.

655
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,618
Sir Patrick Morgan,
at your service.

656
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,992
Diana, princess of the...

657
00:56:15,234 --> 00:56:16,974
"Prince". Diana Prince.

658
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:18,890
She is...

659
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,141
and I..

660
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:21,308
...are...

661
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:22,471
...working together.

662
00:56:22,601 --> 00:56:24,683
She actually helped me bring
this notebook back here.

663
00:56:24,826 --> 00:56:26,488
That's from Dr Maru's lab.

664
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:29,780
I think the information it contains
inside will change the course of the war.

665
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,805
My.. God.

666
00:56:32,845 --> 00:56:34,752
- Dr Poison herself.
- Yes.

667
00:56:38,881 --> 00:56:44,386
P s a g m e n o .com

668
00:57:05,147 --> 00:57:06,148
Yes.

669
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:07,956
Intriguing.

670
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:09,578
Any further intelligence?

671
00:57:09,824 --> 00:57:12,587
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography had no luck.

672
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:14,746
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages...

673
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:18,540
...but as if they failed to
determine which two languages.

674
00:57:18,885 --> 00:57:20,414
Ottoman & Sumerian.

675
00:57:22,748 --> 00:57:25,094
Surely someone else in
this room knew that.

676
00:57:25,374 --> 00:57:26,405
Who is this woman?

677
00:57:26,674 --> 00:57:28,356
She is my...

678
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,191
...secretary, sir.

679
00:57:30,692 --> 00:57:32,924
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

680
00:57:33,327 --> 00:57:34,799
She's a very good secretary.

681
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,778
Sir, if this woman
can read it...

682
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:41,835
...we should hear
what she has to say.

683
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,732
Yes, very well.

684
00:57:49,917 --> 00:57:51,561
It's a formula...

685
00:57:52,043 --> 00:57:54,541
...for a new kind of gas.

686
00:57:54,566 --> 00:57:57,299
Mustard gas, hydrogen
based instead of sulfur.

687
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:58,709
<i>Hydrogen based...</i>

688
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,521
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

689
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,532
The book says, they plan
to release the gas...

690
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:06,209
At the front?

691
00:58:06,422 --> 00:58:07,423
When?

692
00:58:07,516 --> 00:58:08,589
It doesn't say.

693
00:58:09,043 --> 00:58:10,547
Wait. In "front" of what?

694
00:58:10,572 --> 00:58:11,665
Sir...

695
00:58:11,866 --> 00:58:13,321
...that is the
evidence we need.

696
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:15,148
You have to find out where
they are making that gas.

697
00:58:15,149 --> 00:58:16,525
You have to burn
it to the ground.

698
00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:17,746
Destroy it.

699
00:58:17,822 --> 00:58:20,229
Ludendorff was last
seen in Belgium.

700
00:58:20,512 --> 00:58:24,612
We can't be seen in sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium...

701
00:58:24,913 --> 00:58:28,070
...As we are negotiating
their surrender.

702
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:29,974
Sir, I have seen that
gas with my own eyes.

703
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:32,867
If it is used, it will kill
everyone on both sides.

704
00:58:32,892 --> 00:58:33,985
They will all die.

705
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:36,928
Yes, that's what
soldiers do, Captain.

706
00:58:37,493 --> 00:58:39,922
Send me in.. with some
logistical support.

707
00:58:39,947 --> 00:58:42,711
At least give me the chance to take
out Ludendorff's operation myself.

708
00:58:42,735 --> 00:58:43,837
Are you insane?

709
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:46,297
I can't introduce rogue
elements this late in the case.

710
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,234
Sir, I can take...

711
00:58:47,474 --> 00:58:48,718
Now more than ever...

712
00:58:49,002 --> 00:58:52,661
...the armistice is
off paramount importance.

713
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:56,510
It must be negotiated
it must be signed..

714
00:58:57,296 --> 00:58:59,995
It is the best way
of stopping the war.

715
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:02,110
Captain, you will do nothing.

716
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:04,428
And that's an order.

717
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:06,318
Yes sir.

718
00:59:07,671 --> 00:59:08,672
I understand, sir.

719
00:59:09,477 --> 00:59:10,502
I don't!

720
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,271
Diana, I know this confusing...

721
00:59:12,352 --> 00:59:14,685
- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
- Who is this woman?

722
00:59:14,686 --> 00:59:15,802
She is with me, she is with us.

723
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:16,807
I'm not.. I am not with you!

724
00:59:17,085 --> 00:59:20,046
You would knowingly
sacrifice all those lives.

725
00:59:20,047 --> 00:59:21,510
...as if they mean
less than yours.

726
00:59:21,535 --> 00:59:23,622
- Diana, let's talk about it outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

727
00:59:23,623 --> 00:59:26,657
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

728
00:59:26,658 --> 00:59:28,904
That's enough! They fight
alongside their soldiers.

729
00:59:28,905 --> 00:59:30,733
They die with them
on the battlefield!

730
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,458
- That's enough! My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

731
00:59:32,459 --> 00:59:33,531
- My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

732
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:35,605
- Diana... Diana!
- All of you should be ashamed!

733
00:59:37,279 --> 00:59:38,728
Please slow down!

734
00:59:38,946 --> 00:59:40,137
Is that your leader?

735
00:59:40,474 --> 00:59:42,520
How could he say that?
Believe that?

736
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:44,176
And.. and you!

737
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:47,027
- Was your duty to simply give them a book?
 -No!

738
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:48,848
You didn't stand your ground.
You didn't fight.

739
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:50,521
Because there was no chance
of changing anything.

740
00:59:50,522 --> 00:59:53,909
This is Ares and
he's not going to allow negotiation,

741
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:55,259
...nor a surrender!

742
00:59:55,284 --> 00:59:57,986
The millions of people you
talked about, they will die.

743
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,371
We are going anyway!

744
01:00:02,018 --> 01:00:03,576
You mean you were lying?

745
01:00:03,977 --> 01:00:05,676
I'm a spy!
That's what I do!

746
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:07,894
How do I know you're not
lying to me right now?

747
01:00:12,897 --> 01:00:14,453
I'm taking you to the front.

748
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:16,848
We are afraid you're gonna die.

749
01:00:17,927 --> 01:00:19,875
This is a terrible idea.

750
01:00:24,566 --> 01:00:26,313
We're gonna need reinforcements.

751
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:39,087
These are the reinforcements?

752
01:00:39,112 --> 01:00:40,113
Yep.

753
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:42,203
Are these even good men?

754
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:44,414
Well, relatively.

755
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:49,604
Even in Africa gentlemen, we
haven't seen such luxuries.

756
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:53,910
The luxury that we have now is like...
is like we can't stop making money!

757
01:00:53,935 --> 01:00:56,298
So my uncle, the
Prince, and I...

758
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:58,290
Which prince is that?

759
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:01,058
I decided to extend
your profanity...

760
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:02,681
But seriously, which prince?

761
01:01:03,536 --> 01:01:06,150
Hey, Sultan, Angoora,
Next Kashmir...

762
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:08,100
<i>...Care to talk for a minute?</i>

763
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:10,804
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

764
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:13,473
- A bar... Well, a pub.
- You hypocrite.

765
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:16,812
I've been racing those peacock
all night, and you've...

766
01:01:17,225 --> 01:01:18,925
Oh my goodness, gracious.

767
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:20,748
That's a work of art.

768
01:01:20,749 --> 01:01:23,027
Sameer, Diana.
Diana, Sameer!

769
01:01:23,052 --> 01:01:25,305
Hi, Diana. You can
call me Sammy please.

770
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:26,139
"Sammy".

771
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,680
Oh Sameer, I wouldn't...
do that if I were you.

772
01:01:28,723 --> 01:01:30,029
Sameer is a top undercover man.

773
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:32,699
He can talk the skin off a cabbage
many ways as you can.

774
01:01:33,014 --> 01:01:35,708
<i>I do not find it so impressive.</i>

775
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:37,361
<i>You are for me.</i>

776
01:01:37,725 --> 01:01:40,646
<i>Your eyes are as soft as your smile.</i>

777
01:01:40,872 --> 01:01:41,823
<i>And your eyes...</i>

778
01:01:41,848 --> 01:01:44,726
<i>...they have the appearance
of wanting something.</i>

779
01:01:45,164 --> 01:01:47,084
<i>I also speak Chinese, trickster.</i>

780
01:01:47,126 --> 01:01:49,368
<i>Can you recite Socrates
in ancient Greek?</i>

781
01:01:51,729 --> 01:01:52,732
Oh, you're done.

782
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:53,758
Where is Charlie?

783
01:01:57,886 --> 01:01:58,887
Voila!

784
01:02:01,616 --> 01:02:04,025
At least this Charlie
is good with his fists.

785
01:02:05,293 --> 01:02:06,426
That's not Charlie.

786
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:15,510
That's Charlie.

787
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:20,949
Steven!

788
01:02:20,998 --> 01:02:23,939
May god grow a flower
upon your head son.

789
01:02:23,964 --> 01:02:25,083
Good to see you.

790
01:02:26,649 --> 01:02:28,552
So what were you fighting about?

791
01:02:29,795 --> 01:02:31,892
I mistook his glass for mine.

792
01:02:31,992 --> 01:02:32,487
That happens.

793
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,021
This man is no fighter.

794
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:36,243
Charlie is an expert marksman.

795
01:02:37,113 --> 01:02:38,125
Means he shoots people.

796
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,715
From very far away.

797
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,310
You never know what hit 'em.

798
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:46,016
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

799
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:47,903
I don't. Trust me
it's better that way.

800
01:02:48,252 --> 01:02:49,501
You fight without honor.

801
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:51,658
Who gets paid for honor?

802
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:54,425
So, what's the job, boss?

803
01:02:55,923 --> 01:02:56,939
Two days tops.

804
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,562
We need supplies and
passage to Belgium.

805
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:00,831
What's the going rate?

806
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,107
Better be a good pay.

807
01:03:02,108 --> 01:03:04,319
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

808
01:03:06,464 --> 01:03:07,465
..will be quick.

809
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,129
And there's a lot to
be gained by this.

810
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:13,328
It's for a great cause...

811
01:03:14,627 --> 01:03:15,628
...Freedom.

812
01:03:16,162 --> 01:03:17,570
Friendship...

813
01:03:20,139 --> 01:03:21,336
...ending the war, friendship...

814
01:03:21,337 --> 01:03:22,693
- Okay, You have no money.
- No.

815
01:03:22,694 --> 01:03:25,971
<i>All I want now is a picture
of that beautiful face.</i>

816
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:28,951
<i>You will not need a photo...</i>

817
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:30,286
<i>...because I'll go with you.</i>

818
01:03:30,957 --> 01:03:31,958
What?

819
01:03:32,013 --> 01:03:33,083
What is this?

820
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:34,444
We're gonna drop her up at front!

821
01:03:34,735 --> 01:03:36,337
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

822
01:03:37,035 --> 01:03:39,094
Question sweetheart, I am not
gonna get myself killed...

823
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:40,495
...with helping every last human.

824
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:43,141
- That's NO I mean.
- Here's the little thief now!

825
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:00,039
I am both frightened and aroused.

826
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,212
Oh here they are! Sorry I'm late.
Sir Patrick!

827
01:04:08,237 --> 01:04:09,856
Yes, that's what I
was gonna mention.

828
01:04:11,233 --> 01:04:12,892
- Sir Patrick.
- No... No..!

829
01:04:13,337 --> 01:04:15,371
Gentlemen, sit.
Ms. Prince, sit..

830
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,493
I assume you are here
planning something...

831
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:25,420
...that's going to get you
either court martial or killed.

832
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,409
And I assume,
you are here to stop us.

833
01:04:27,959 --> 01:04:28,960
No.

834
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:31,251
Not at all in fact..

835
01:04:32,075 --> 01:04:33,017
Well, look.

836
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:34,209
I was an younger man once.

837
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:38,120
Had I been in better health,
I like to think that I might do the same.

838
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:41,654
It's very very honorable
thing you're doing.

839
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:42,781
Therefore..

840
01:04:43,832 --> 01:04:45,133
...I am here to help.

841
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:47,107
Unofficially, of course.

842
01:04:48,248 --> 01:04:49,476
What's your plan?

843
01:04:51,007 --> 01:04:54,112
If there's another weapon's
facility, find it and destroy it.

844
01:04:54,581 --> 01:04:56,389
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

845
01:04:57,478 --> 01:05:00,062
In that case, to
allay suspicion...

846
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:05,409
...our charming Etta could run
the mission from my office.

847
01:05:05,763 --> 01:05:06,764
"Run"...

848
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:09,909
Also.

849
01:05:10,944 --> 01:05:13,402
...There is enough
here for a few days.

850
01:05:19,046 --> 01:05:20,047
Thank you sir.

851
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,523
You're very welcome.

852
01:05:22,395 --> 01:05:24,149
Take great care all of you...

853
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:25,175
...and good luck.

854
01:05:46,483 --> 01:05:48,385
Fresh ice-cream.

855
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,390
Hello miss, would you like
to buy an ice cream?

856
01:05:50,511 --> 01:05:51,930
- Me?
- You hungry?

857
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:53,183
Yes.

858
01:05:53,624 --> 01:05:54,362
Thank you.

859
01:05:54,387 --> 01:05:55,828
Eight pence please, sir.

860
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,292
There you go, keep the change.

861
01:05:57,293 --> 01:05:58,835
Thank you very much sir.

862
01:05:59,986 --> 01:06:01,488
- What you doing?
- It's wonderful!

863
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:02,665
Yeah.

864
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,292
- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!

865
01:06:06,317 --> 01:06:07,694
You should be very proud.

866
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,975
I hope I got niches here.
The chief's expecting us before dark.

867
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:23,228
Chief?

868
01:06:24,253 --> 01:06:25,834
Oh yeah.
A smuggler.

869
01:06:26,671 --> 01:06:28,028
Very reputable.

870
01:06:28,457 --> 01:06:31,434
A liar, a murderer,
and now a smuggler.

871
01:06:32,038 --> 01:06:33,039
Lovely.

872
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:34,710
Careful, I might get offended.

873
01:06:34,734 --> 01:06:36,236
I wasn't referring to you.

874
01:06:37,087 --> 01:06:38,088
Really?

875
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:40,350
I wanna recover from pretending
to be somebody else.

876
01:06:40,475 --> 01:06:42,424
...I shot people on your
beach, muggle a notebook.

877
01:06:42,425 --> 01:06:45,030
A liar, murderer and smuggler.
You still coming?

878
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:05,584
It's awful.

879
01:07:06,924 --> 01:07:08,367
That's why we're here.

880
01:07:26,506 --> 01:07:28,242
The gas will kill everything.

881
01:07:28,267 --> 01:07:30,691
What kind weapons
kills innocents?

882
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:33,112
In this war...

883
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:34,381
...Every kind.

884
01:07:40,027 --> 01:07:42,744
You were absent at the
counsel meeting, General.

885
01:07:42,769 --> 01:07:45,626
I see you are negotiating the
terms of the armistice without me.

886
01:07:45,651 --> 01:07:48,155
- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- I'm on your insistence.

887
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:52,038
We could easily win this war if
only you had a little faith.

888
01:07:52,063 --> 01:07:53,294
We don't.

889
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,649
There are shortages of food...

890
01:07:55,674 --> 01:07:57,519
...meds and ammunition.

891
01:07:58,526 --> 01:08:02,410
Every hour we delay costs
thousands of German lives.

892
01:08:02,535 --> 01:08:05,267
One attack and the
world could be ours.

893
01:08:07,628 --> 01:08:09,659
As we speak, my chemistry...

894
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:11,831
We stand against you and your...

895
01:08:11,856 --> 01:08:13,095
...witch.

896
01:08:13,831 --> 01:08:19,010
Ludendorff, enough!
24 hours from now...

897
01:08:19,035 --> 01:08:21,007
...this war will end.

898
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:23,191
It is over.

899
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,808
It's over for you.

900
01:08:29,712 --> 01:08:31,021
It is over for all of you..

901
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,648
But the mask won't help.

902
01:08:49,673 --> 01:08:50,916
They don't know that.

903
01:09:05,868 --> 01:09:07,128
Let's go.

904
01:09:07,153 --> 01:09:09,805
Time to stage a demonstration
for the Kaiser!

905
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,011
You're late.

906
01:09:13,012 --> 01:09:14,438
Avoid sneak attack, chief!

907
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:16,282
How are you?

908
01:09:17,197 --> 01:09:19,193
- Good to see you pal.
- Big mike.

909
01:09:21,706 --> 01:09:23,434
- Good to see you.
- Oh yes!

910
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,828
Good to see you my friend.

911
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:27,815
Yaa beauty!

912
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,610
Who is this?

913
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,166
And I am Diana.

914
01:09:39,557 --> 01:09:40,607
Where did you find her?

915
01:09:40,771 --> 01:09:42,035
She found me.

916
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,628
- I plucked him from the sea.
- Well. It's a long story.

917
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:46,241
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

918
01:09:46,242 --> 01:09:47,643
What's there?

919
01:09:49,032 --> 01:09:50,934
British tea from the Germans...

920
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:53,150
...German beer for the British.

921
01:09:53,175 --> 01:09:57,240
And Edgar Rice Brurroughs
novels for both.

922
01:09:57,451 --> 01:09:58,752
And guns!

923
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,521
Well...
May we get what we want?

924
01:10:03,546 --> 01:10:04,754
May we get what we need.

925
01:10:05,148 --> 01:10:07,149
But may we never get
what we deserve.

926
01:10:07,174 --> 01:10:08,175
Bang!

927
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:17,023
Strange thunder.

928
01:10:18,538 --> 01:10:20,045
German 77's.

929
01:10:20,394 --> 01:10:21,816
Guns, big ones.

930
01:10:23,131 --> 01:10:24,377
It's the front out there.

931
01:10:25,581 --> 01:10:29,605
- The evening hay.
- So, who do you fight for in this war?

932
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:30,899
I don't fight.

933
01:10:30,924 --> 01:10:32,789
You're here for profits then?

934
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:35,235
No better place to be.

935
01:10:36,225 --> 01:10:38,707
Nowhere better to be than in a
war where you don't take a side.

936
01:10:39,126 --> 01:10:41,283
I have no where else.
The last war took

937
01:10:41,308 --> 01:10:43,948
everything from my people.
We have nothing left.

938
01:10:44,643 --> 01:10:46,013
At least here...

939
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,799
...I'm free.

940
01:10:48,618 --> 01:10:50,383
Who took that from your people?

941
01:10:51,145 --> 01:10:52,326
His people.

942
01:10:57,283 --> 01:10:58,331
Don't go...

943
01:10:59,202 --> 01:11:01,981
Don't go there.
Do not go!

944
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,339
Don't go in there.

945
01:11:05,364 --> 01:11:06,462
You are safe.

946
01:11:06,663 --> 01:11:09,293
You are safe.
Are you okay?

947
01:11:09,537 --> 01:11:10,862
Shut up, you woman!

948
01:11:10,887 --> 01:11:12,640
Stop making a fuss!

949
01:11:12,963 --> 01:11:14,122
God!

950
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,582
He sees ghosts.

951
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,608
Hey, you're gonna get cold.

952
01:11:26,633 --> 01:11:27,855
Alright there...

953
01:11:28,334 --> 01:11:30,785
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean any, alright?

954
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:52,964
The animals, why are
they hurting them?

955
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:55,107
Because they need to move quick!

956
01:11:55,355 --> 01:11:56,967
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

957
01:11:57,723 --> 01:11:59,187
I could help them.

958
01:11:59,188 --> 01:12:00,491
There is no time.
Come on, woman!

959
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:04,921
Mama!

960
01:12:09,683 --> 01:12:11,804
That man... he's wounded.

961
01:12:11,805 --> 01:12:13,962
There is nothing you can
do about it, Diana.

962
01:12:14,232 --> 01:12:15,544
We must keep moving.

963
01:12:36,829 --> 01:12:37,986
What is this?

964
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:40,079
You wanted me to take you to war.
This is it.

965
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:41,576
Then where are the Germans?

966
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,084
Couple of 100 yards
across the field.

967
01:12:44,348 --> 01:12:45,771
- The trench is...
- Watch out!

968
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:50,458
Chief! Oh it's good to see you.

969
01:12:50,758 --> 01:12:52,923
Oi, chief's back! He's back!

970
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:55,391
Alright, let's move.

971
01:12:56,624 --> 01:12:58,365
<i>Help me please.</i>

972
01:12:58,658 --> 01:13:00,530
<i>They took everything...</i>

973
01:13:00,531 --> 01:13:02,537
<i>...houses, food...</i>

974
01:13:02,781 --> 01:13:04,617
<i>...and those who
could not escape...</i>

975
01:13:04,834 --> 01:13:06,733
<i>...they were taken
away as slaves.</i>

976
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:07,976
<i>Where was that?</i>

977
01:13:07,977 --> 01:13:11,257
<i>In Veld... On the other
side of No Man's Land.</i>

978
01:13:11,258 --> 01:13:12,355
Diana, we have to go.

979
01:13:12,356 --> 01:13:13,793
We need to help these people.

980
01:13:13,818 --> 01:13:14,965
We have to stay on mission!

981
01:13:14,966 --> 01:13:16,647
Next safe crossing is
at least a day away.

982
01:13:16,861 --> 01:13:19,429
- What are we waiting for?
- We can not leave without helping them.

983
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:20,964
These people are dying.

984
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:22,840
Nothing to eat and
in the village...

985
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:24,495
- enslaved it there!
- I understand that.

986
01:13:24,496 --> 01:13:25,497
Women and children!

987
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,797
We need to make our next
position by sunset.

988
01:13:26,798 --> 01:13:28,838
How can you say that? What
is the matter with you?

989
01:13:29,501 --> 01:13:31,461
This is No Man's Land! Diana!

990
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,985
Means no man can
cross it, alright?

991
01:13:33,986 --> 01:13:36,409
This battalion has been
here for nearly a year...

992
01:13:36,434 --> 01:13:38,992
...and they barely
gained an inch.

993
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:41,905
Alright? Because on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

994
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:44,732
...pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

995
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:47,231
This is not something you can cross.
This is not possible.

996
01:13:47,232 --> 01:13:48,624
So what? So we do nothing?

997
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,715
No, we are doing something.

998
01:13:50,716 --> 01:13:52,095
- We are, we just...
- Steve.

999
01:13:52,342 --> 01:13:53,731
We can't save
everyone in this war.

1000
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:55,190
Steve...

1001
01:13:55,423 --> 01:13:57,080
This is not what we
came here to do.

1002
01:14:13,529 --> 01:14:14,530
No...

1003
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:16,482
...but it's what
I'm going to do.

1004
01:14:31,756 --> 01:14:33,015
Diana!

1005
01:14:55,202 --> 01:14:57,493
What the bloody hell she's playing at?

1006
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:05,658
<i>Engage, fire!</i>

1007
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,286
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1008
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:21,862
Sniper! Stand down!

1009
01:15:21,863 --> 01:15:23,410
Stay down! That's an order!

1010
01:16:16,597 --> 01:16:17,598
Come on!

1011
01:16:17,755 --> 01:16:19,502
She's done it!
Let's go!

1012
01:16:39,525 --> 01:16:40,526
Steve!

1013
01:16:40,957 --> 01:16:42,104
Let's go!

1014
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:46,608
Come on, go!

1015
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:08,617
Stay here, I'll go ahead.

1016
01:17:44,156 --> 01:17:45,433
- What the...
- Let's move.

1017
01:18:23,818 --> 01:18:25,245
We need more firepower.

1018
01:19:41,741 --> 01:19:42,742
Sniper!

1019
01:19:42,806 --> 01:19:44,019
Move!

1020
01:19:46,355 --> 01:19:47,120
Get in!

1021
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:48,828
Charlie, bell tower.

1022
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,354
Come on, Charlie. Shoot him.

1023
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:01,467
It's okay.

1024
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:08,447
Follow me.
Give me some cover.

1025
01:20:15,155 --> 01:20:16,209
Good!

1026
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:19,289
We're gonna put this on our
back and when I say go..

1027
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,475
- ...Lift hard!
- All right.

1028
01:20:21,546 --> 01:20:23,659
Diana! Shield!

1029
01:20:27,356 --> 01:20:28,357
Go!

1030
01:21:30,855 --> 01:21:33,134
Stay very very still,
for me my friends.

1031
01:21:33,159 --> 01:21:34,597
Please. It's so important.

1032
01:21:38,567 --> 01:21:39,737
Thank you very much.

1033
01:21:39,762 --> 01:21:42,631
This has been such an honor
for me taking you photograph.

1034
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,722
Thank you so much.

1035
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:52,377
For obvious talk of shooting...

1036
01:21:52,698 --> 01:21:54,469
...you cannot shoot.

1037
01:21:57,116 --> 01:21:59,534
Not everyone gets to be where
they want to be all the time.

1038
01:22:00,199 --> 01:22:02,581
Me, I'm an actor.

1039
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:04,043
I love acting.

1040
01:22:04,309 --> 01:22:05,926
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1041
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:08,576
But I'm the wrong color.

1042
01:22:09,589 --> 01:22:11,878
Everyone's fighting their
own battle, Diana.

1043
01:22:13,534 --> 01:22:14,839
Truth is you're fighting yours.

1044
01:22:20,991 --> 01:22:22,895
<i>It's too much. I wish you...</i>

1045
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:23,897
<i>Thank you.</i>

1046
01:22:28,012 --> 01:22:29,589
Hi.. I'm on the phone...

1047
01:22:30,007 --> 01:22:33,079
Ah, it's "Veld", V-E-L-D.

1048
01:22:33,104 --> 01:22:34,811
It's a tiny village.

1049
01:22:34,836 --> 01:22:36,692
It may not even be on the map.

1050
01:22:36,717 --> 01:22:38,008
I found it!

1051
01:22:38,062 --> 01:22:40,122
Did you find
Ludendorff's operation?

1052
01:22:40,147 --> 01:22:41,861
No. No, but I located him.

1053
01:22:42,027 --> 01:22:44,898
And oh, lucky you, he's
only a few miles away...

1054
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:46,639
...At German High Command.

1055
01:22:47,096 --> 01:22:48,639
The German High Command?

1056
01:22:48,762 --> 01:22:50,116
And to Intel report...

1057
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:52,608
...Ludendorff is
hosting a gala..

1058
01:22:52,824 --> 01:22:54,142
Sort of a last hara...

1059
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:56,969
...before the Germans
sign the armistice.

1060
01:22:56,994 --> 01:22:59,849
And then the Kaiser himself
is going to be there.

1061
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:02,502
As well as Dr. Maru.

1062
01:23:03,253 --> 01:23:04,900
Actually the Gala could
be perfect cover.

1063
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:06,887
- Captain Trevor.
- Yes sir.

1064
01:23:06,912 --> 01:23:10,116
You're under no circumstances
to go anywhere near that...

1065
01:23:10,141 --> 01:23:11,678
...gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1066
01:23:11,729 --> 01:23:14,245
You'll be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.

1067
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:16,088
You can not compromise
the armistice.

1068
01:23:16,553 --> 01:23:18,024
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1069
01:23:18,025 --> 01:23:20,018
.. once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1070
01:23:20,272 --> 01:23:21,326
Hold on one second, sir.

1071
01:23:21,351 --> 01:23:23,636
We shouldn't be bothered about
setting the peace agreement.

1072
01:23:23,637 --> 01:23:25,313
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1073
01:23:25,914 --> 01:23:26,915
What?

1074
01:23:27,441 --> 01:23:28,442
What is that?

1075
01:23:28,701 --> 01:23:30,814
Of course, it makes
complete sense.

1076
01:23:32,404 --> 01:23:35,490
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1077
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:37,192
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1078
01:23:37,757 --> 01:23:39,151
I mean Ares.

1079
01:23:39,797 --> 01:23:41,955
Ludendorff is Ares!

1080
01:23:42,845 --> 01:23:44,887
Sir, this is our last chance...

1081
01:23:44,912 --> 01:23:46,662
...our final chance to find
out where the gas is...

1082
01:23:46,663 --> 01:23:48,988
...and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1083
01:23:49,013 --> 01:23:50,890
No... No.. No. I forbid it.

1084
01:23:50,915 --> 01:23:52,065
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1085
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:53,816
Sir, I am losing you! Sir?

1086
01:23:53,841 --> 01:23:55,271
- Hello?
- Sir...

1087
01:23:58,574 --> 01:24:00,251
How likely is he to
respect my wishes?

1088
01:24:00,276 --> 01:24:02,560
Not very like convinced.

1089
01:24:08,188 --> 01:24:09,990
Sammy, Sammy, no, no.

1090
01:24:10,468 --> 01:24:11,582
Sammy, I have to work.

1091
01:24:11,989 --> 01:24:15,392
I gotta rustle up with a German uniform
I took to plough the course tomorrow.

1092
01:24:15,492 --> 01:24:16,690
That's easy, boss.
Come on.

1093
01:24:16,939 --> 01:24:18,481
There's nothing we can
do till tomorrow.

1094
01:24:18,482 --> 01:24:19,523
You said yourself, Steve.

1095
01:24:25,442 --> 01:24:26,806
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1096
01:24:45,048 --> 01:24:46,239
You did this.

1097
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,554
We did.

1098
01:24:54,308 --> 01:24:55,900
Do you have dancing on...

1099
01:24:56,949 --> 01:24:58,164
...Paradise Island?

1100
01:24:58,189 --> 01:24:59,910
Oh, dancing, yeah of course.

1101
01:25:00,891 --> 01:25:04,050
These people are just...
swaying.

1102
01:25:05,047 --> 01:25:08,401
Okay, if you're gonna be
fighting the God of war...

1103
01:25:08,402 --> 01:25:11,822
...I might as well teach you how
to dance, you poor thing.

1104
01:25:11,877 --> 01:25:14,440
Alright, probably
without the gun.

1105
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:20,018
If you would...

1106
01:25:20,868 --> 01:25:21,869
Well...

1107
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:26,402
If I'm going to the Gala, I'll
need to know how to dance.

1108
01:25:26,427 --> 01:25:27,562
- You aren't going to the Gala.
- Of course I am.

1109
01:25:27,563 --> 01:25:29,614
- No.
- Why wouldn't I?

1110
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:31,724
Well, for one, you don't
know how to dance.

1111
01:25:32,354 --> 01:25:34,705
I would argue with this, they
don't know how to dance.

1112
01:25:34,954 --> 01:25:36,133
Be polite. Be polite.

1113
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,319
All right.
Give me your hand.

1114
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,593
Like so.

1115
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:46,485
And I'll put my arm...

1116
01:25:46,486 --> 01:25:48,350
...around you like so.

1117
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:51,162
And we just..

1118
01:25:51,501 --> 01:25:52,904
What do you call it? Sway?

1119
01:25:52,929 --> 01:25:53,930
We'll just sway.

1120
01:25:54,619 --> 01:25:56,188
You're awfully close.

1121
01:25:58,422 --> 01:26:00,475
Nice ritz.

1122
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:04,683
I see.

1123
01:26:13,448 --> 01:26:15,630
I haven't heard him
sing in years.

1124
01:26:32,967 --> 01:26:34,921
It's started to snowfall.

1125
01:26:39,256 --> 01:26:40,343
Touch it.

1126
01:26:43,816 --> 01:26:45,320
It's magical!

1127
01:26:45,885 --> 01:26:47,517
It is, isn't it?

1128
01:26:49,706 --> 01:26:51,021
Yes, yeah.

1129
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,086
Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?

1130
01:27:02,057 --> 01:27:03,058
Yeah.

1131
01:27:04,096 --> 01:27:07,099
Yeah, this... and other things.

1132
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:08,772
What things?

1133
01:27:16,282 --> 01:27:17,825
They have breakfast.

1134
01:27:18,446 --> 01:27:20,035
They really love a breakfast.

1135
01:27:20,063 --> 01:27:22,898
And they love to wake up...

1136
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:26,042
...read the paper
and go to work.

1137
01:27:27,121 --> 01:27:28,739
They get married.

1138
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:31,228
Makes some babies and
grow old together.

1139
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:32,772
I guess.

1140
01:27:36,764 --> 01:27:38,315
What is that like?

1141
01:27:42,445 --> 01:27:43,879
I have no idea.

1142
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:20,318
The villagers gave them to us.

1143
01:29:21,118 --> 01:29:23,706
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1144
01:29:24,283 --> 01:29:25,284
You are.

1145
01:29:25,949 --> 01:29:27,646
Hey, fellas, I know that...

1146
01:29:28,944 --> 01:29:30,835
...I said this job
was 2 day's...

1147
01:29:32,877 --> 01:29:34,078
...and a deal is a deal.

1148
01:29:36,225 --> 01:29:37,683
You can't last without us.

1149
01:29:38,571 --> 01:29:39,572
Yeah.

1150
01:29:39,786 --> 01:29:41,948
We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.

1151
01:29:42,509 --> 01:29:44,282
I'm worried that
you won't make it.

1152
01:29:44,987 --> 01:29:45,812
No more money.

1153
01:29:45,837 --> 01:29:47,229
We have been paid enough.

1154
01:29:51,103 --> 01:29:52,607
No, Charlie.

1155
01:29:53,985 --> 01:29:55,942
Who will sing for us?

1156
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,949
- Yeah.
- Oh no, please.

1157
01:29:59,989 --> 01:30:01,055
Sing?

1158
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:03,445
You asked for it.

1159
01:30:03,626 --> 01:30:05,970
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1160
01:30:06,447 --> 01:30:10,071
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1161
01:30:10,334 --> 01:30:13,861
<i>The sweetest hours I could live.</i>

1162
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:17,097
You must think I was
born yesterday.

1163
01:30:17,314 --> 01:30:19,021
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.

1164
01:30:19,286 --> 01:30:20,377
Every word.

1165
01:30:20,867 --> 01:30:22,131
Wait...wait.

1166
01:30:22,132 --> 01:30:24,270
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1167
01:30:24,472 --> 01:30:26,076
And not a single man among them?

1168
01:30:27,247 --> 01:30:28,417
How do we get there?

1169
01:30:29,497 --> 01:30:30,618
And she thinks..

1170
01:30:30,619 --> 01:30:32,771
...that Ludendorff is
Ares, the god of war?

1171
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:34,589
And only by killing
him will the war end.

1172
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:37,942
Don't be daft.
You saw what happened out there.

1173
01:30:38,136 --> 01:30:40,039
The way she dropped
that machine gun next.

1174
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,135
The way she took out the tower?

1175
01:30:43,894 --> 01:30:45,293
May be it's true.

1176
01:30:46,431 --> 01:30:47,683
I think it's true.

1177
01:30:48,305 --> 01:30:49,319
I believe it's true.

1178
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:54,008
Steven son, you don't really
believe those rubbish thing?

1179
01:31:17,335 --> 01:31:19,459
Diana, Diana, hide in..

1180
01:31:21,825 --> 01:31:23,650
How the hell do
we get into that?

1181
01:31:24,209 --> 01:31:26,867
I see only a couple of guards
in the door to distract.

1182
01:31:27,122 --> 01:31:28,448
Yeah, it won't look
suspicious...

1183
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:30,214
...when I wanna come
sauntering out of the woods.

1184
01:31:30,215 --> 01:31:31,006
I could get in.

1185
01:31:31,182 --> 01:31:33,192
You are not going in
there, it's too dangerous.

1186
01:31:33,217 --> 01:31:34,699
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1187
01:31:34,713 --> 01:31:35,983
And you are too distracting.

1188
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:38,260
Look, I will go in there, to find..

1189
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:40,989
...where ever they are working on the gas or
better yet, where it is.

1190
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,406
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not coming with me.

1191
01:31:43,463 --> 01:31:45,395
What you're wearing isn't
exactly undercover.

1192
01:31:45,921 --> 01:31:46,511
I don't know.

1193
01:31:46,512 --> 01:31:49,311
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1194
01:31:49,336 --> 01:31:52,844
It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
It's all scouted out, we'll put back...

1195
01:31:52,869 --> 01:31:54,671
But as long as he's still
alive, it doesn't...

1196
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,067
You cannot go into German high command
and not kill anyone.

1197
01:31:57,612 --> 01:31:59,421
You just can't.
You have to trust me.

1198
01:32:00,788 --> 01:32:02,345
- Oh, Wow!
- Where did that come from?

1199
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:04,695
Oh, can I drive it?
Please let me drive it!

1200
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:05,891
Yes, I'll be your chauffeur.

1201
01:32:05,993 --> 01:32:07,237
Come on... come on.

1202
01:32:08,115 --> 01:32:09,116
Stay put!

1203
01:32:10,662 --> 01:32:11,537
Where this come from?

1204
01:32:11,737 --> 01:32:13,218
A field over there.
It is full of them!

1205
01:32:17,733 --> 01:32:19,153
Chief, I think you and
me scope out the area...

1206
01:32:19,154 --> 01:32:21,023
...in case we need to
beat the haste and retreat.

1207
01:32:21,024 --> 01:32:22,600
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1208
01:32:27,925 --> 01:32:28,926
Colonel.

1209
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:35,628
Steve, they have invitations.

1210
01:32:37,179 --> 01:32:39,457
Don't worry. Play it cool,
you go this, you got this.

1211
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,182
Your invitation, please.

1212
01:32:45,207 --> 01:32:47,393
<i>Thank you sir.</i>
The Colonel and I wish...

1213
01:32:47,418 --> 01:32:49,765
...many blessings and all my
love to fall up in your head.

1214
01:32:50,016 --> 01:32:53,525
Your head must be empty.
Find the invitation, you idiot.

1215
01:32:53,825 --> 01:32:54,826
I am sorry.

1216
01:32:54,964 --> 01:32:57,566
I am so sorry, I must apologize
a thousand times, my master.

1217
01:32:57,799 --> 01:33:00,766
I made the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1218
01:33:01,057 --> 01:33:03,083
- I lost the Colonel's invitation.
- What?

1219
01:33:03,384 --> 01:33:05,996
You saying we come all the way
through the mud and rain...

1220
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:09,484
- ...Only for you to loose my invitation?
- No, I am a bug.

1221
01:33:09,509 --> 01:33:11,655
Not even a bug, I'm
a dung of a bug.

1222
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:12,899
And you're right master...

1223
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:14,696
Blessing will up on us.

1224
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:26,596
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

1225
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:28,846
<i>I'm not gonna be spending
my evening out here.</i>

1226
01:33:29,233 --> 01:33:31,350
<i>You stupid idiots!
Move your car!</i>

1227
01:33:52,848 --> 01:33:54,436
What are you supposed to be?

1228
01:33:58,033 --> 01:33:59,606
What are you doing?

1229
01:34:24,293 --> 01:34:25,312
Excuse me.

1230
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:29,854
I don't drink.

1231
01:34:37,979 --> 01:34:39,004
Have we met?

1232
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:40,789
No, but I have
been watching you.

1233
01:34:42,183 --> 01:34:43,531
Following your career.

1234
01:34:44,628 --> 01:34:47,143
You are Dr. Isabel Maru.

1235
01:34:47,168 --> 01:34:49,711
The most talented chemist
in the German army.

1236
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:51,646
I am a friend.

1237
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,797
I hope I'm not causing...

1238
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:08,796
I know you and General
Ludendorff are...

1239
01:35:08,821 --> 01:35:09,786
...very close.

1240
01:35:09,811 --> 01:35:13,331
We work well together.
Yes.

1241
01:35:13,909 --> 01:35:16,897
Tell me some one like
me behind you...

1242
01:35:17,952 --> 01:35:19,554
I could provide a lot more.

1243
01:35:19,579 --> 01:35:21,347
And who are you?

1244
01:35:21,552 --> 01:35:25,636
A man who shows you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1245
01:35:32,326 --> 01:35:34,896
I love fire. Don't you?

1246
01:35:37,287 --> 01:35:38,933
It is like...

1247
01:35:40,587 --> 01:35:42,689
...a living act of entropy.

1248
01:35:42,714 --> 01:35:45,328
The ultimate weapon
of destruction.

1249
01:35:46,013 --> 01:35:48,239
Reminding us that in the end...

1250
01:35:48,911 --> 01:35:52,077
...everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1251
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:57,845
There is something reassuring about it.

1252
01:36:02,446 --> 01:36:04,559
I see all of that in your eyes.

1253
01:36:08,034 --> 01:36:10,246
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1254
01:36:13,271 --> 01:36:18,271
Resync by AnyiNk for
nonton01.com

1255
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:28,097
I hear it is...

1256
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:32,380
I hear it is extraordinary.

1257
01:36:33,344 --> 01:36:36,968
I appreciate your
interest in my work...

1258
01:36:36,993 --> 01:36:39,349
...but I'm loyal to
General Ludendorff.

1259
01:36:39,835 --> 01:36:40,856
Besides...

1260
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:43,521
...Now I see your
attention is...

1261
01:36:46,997 --> 01:36:47,998
...elsewhere.

1262
01:37:12,111 --> 01:37:14,032
Enjoying the party?

1263
01:37:16,054 --> 01:37:18,857
I confess I'm not sure what
it is we're celebrating.

1264
01:37:18,882 --> 01:37:21,778
A German victory, of course.

1265
01:37:22,279 --> 01:37:23,083
Victory?

1266
01:37:23,108 --> 01:37:25,508
But I hear peace
would be so close.

1267
01:37:25,703 --> 01:37:26,811
Peace?

1268
01:37:26,929 --> 01:37:28,698
It's only an armistice...

1269
01:37:28,972 --> 01:37:30,852
...and an endless war.

1270
01:37:31,173 --> 01:37:32,628
Thucydides.

1271
01:37:33,035 --> 01:37:34,674
You know your ancient Greeks?

1272
01:37:34,938 --> 01:37:36,682
They understood...

1273
01:37:36,902 --> 01:37:38,981
...that war was a god.

1274
01:37:39,086 --> 01:37:41,365
A god who requires human sacrifices.

1275
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:42,931
And in exchange...

1276
01:37:42,956 --> 01:37:45,696
...war gives man purpose...

1277
01:37:45,721 --> 01:37:47,667
...meaning, a
chance to rise...

1278
01:37:47,692 --> 01:37:50,070
...above his petty,
mortal little self...

1279
01:37:50,805 --> 01:37:52,120
...and be courageous...

1280
01:37:52,943 --> 01:37:54,333
...Noble!

1281
01:37:55,569 --> 01:37:58,783
Only one of the many
gods believed in that.

1282
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:01,366
And he was wrong.

1283
01:38:02,663 --> 01:38:04,048
You know nothing of the gods.

1284
01:38:04,073 --> 01:38:05,580
<i>Herr General.</i>

1285
01:38:08,709 --> 01:38:10,264
Enjoy the fireworks.

1286
01:38:15,875 --> 01:38:16,936
What are you doing?

1287
01:38:16,961 --> 01:38:18,403
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1288
01:38:18,532 --> 01:38:20,368
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas...

1289
01:38:20,369 --> 01:38:21,781
...we won't be able to stop anything.

1290
01:38:21,782 --> 01:38:22,961
I will stop Ares!

1291
01:38:22,986 --> 01:38:24,519
What if you're wrong?

1292
01:38:26,088 --> 01:38:27,690
What if there's no Ares?

1293
01:38:29,452 --> 01:38:30,904
You don't believe me.

1294
01:38:31,006 --> 01:38:32,741
I can not let you do this.

1295
01:38:33,402 --> 01:38:34,860
What I do is not up to you.

1296
01:38:41,665 --> 01:38:42,818
Diana!

1297
01:38:47,093 --> 01:38:48,094
Diana...

1298
01:38:48,594 --> 01:38:49,595
The gas.

1299
01:38:50,602 --> 01:38:52,610
The villagers!

1300
01:38:54,779 --> 01:38:56,412
What they cheering for?

1301
01:38:58,959 --> 01:39:00,038
Diana!

1302
01:39:02,429 --> 01:39:04,036
What did they fire?

1303
01:39:04,349 --> 01:39:05,350
The gas.

1304
01:39:05,381 --> 01:39:07,421
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him, he was in the tower.

1305
01:39:07,422 --> 01:39:08,891
Wherever he goes you follow.

1306
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:11,124
How will you find us?

1307
01:39:11,609 --> 01:39:13,044
I know how.

1308
01:40:30,543 --> 01:40:31,891
Diana!

1309
01:40:34,886 --> 01:40:37,547
They are dead.
They are all dead.

1310
01:40:38,463 --> 01:40:40,114
I could have saved them.

1311
01:40:40,444 --> 01:40:42,786
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1312
01:40:43,029 --> 01:40:45,005
You stopped me
from killing Ares!

1313
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:47,593
- No!
- Get away from me!

1314
01:40:47,788 --> 01:40:49,285
I understand everything now.

1315
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:51,096
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1316
01:40:51,097 --> 01:40:52,414
It's you too.

1317
01:40:53,099 --> 01:40:54,126
All of you.

1318
01:40:55,322 --> 01:40:56,627
I'll find Ares...

1319
01:40:56,848 --> 01:40:58,412
...and I'll kill him.

1320
01:41:01,732 --> 01:41:02,867
Diana!

1321
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:05,018
That smoke...

1322
01:41:06,155 --> 01:41:07,156
...it's the chief!

1323
01:41:07,177 --> 01:41:08,625
He followed Ludendorff.

1324
01:41:09,815 --> 01:41:11,698
Follow the smoke!

1325
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:39,710
Hey! Diana, Over there!

1326
01:41:56,123 --> 01:41:57,324
Come on. Let's go!

1327
01:42:19,402 --> 01:42:21,011
Ooh, what a surprise.

1328
01:42:21,637 --> 01:42:22,929
Strange.

1329
01:42:24,307 --> 01:42:26,413
Unfortunately, I have
another matter...

1330
01:42:27,471 --> 01:42:28,472
...to attend to.

1331
01:42:33,634 --> 01:42:36,138
What are you?

1332
01:42:36,139 --> 01:42:37,378
You will soon find out.

1333
01:43:11,979 --> 01:43:15,696
As magnificent as you are,
you are still no match for me.

1334
01:43:19,545 --> 01:43:21,528
We'll see about that.

1335
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,863
I am Diana of Temiscira...

1336
01:43:49,768 --> 01:43:51,625
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1337
01:43:52,644 --> 01:43:55,029
...Queen of the Amazons.

1338
01:43:57,752 --> 01:44:00,499
And your wrath upon
this world is over.

1339
01:44:17,982 --> 01:44:20,481
In the name of all that it
is good in this world...

1340
01:44:20,732 --> 01:44:23,333
...I hereby complete the
mission of the Amazons...

1341
01:44:23,619 --> 01:44:25,421
...to ridding this
world of you...

1342
01:44:25,675 --> 01:44:26,677
...forever!

1343
01:45:34,236 --> 01:45:35,237
Diana?

1344
01:45:40,972 --> 01:45:41,973
Diana!

1345
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:47,788
I killed him.

1346
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:51,607
I killed him, but nothing stops.

1347
01:45:53,554 --> 01:45:55,727
If you kill the god of
war, you stop the war.

1348
01:45:56,003 --> 01:45:57,993
Exactly what we have to do now.

1349
01:45:58,374 --> 01:45:59,576
We must stop the gas.
Come on.

1350
01:45:59,789 --> 01:46:01,249
No. All of this should
have stopped.

1351
01:46:01,358 --> 01:46:02,306
Diana...

1352
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:04,337
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they?

1353
01:46:04,338 --> 01:46:06,412
I don't know! I don't know.

1354
01:46:06,633 --> 01:46:08,133
Ares is dead.

1355
01:46:08,134 --> 01:46:10,726
They can now stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?

1356
01:46:10,934 --> 01:46:12,627
That's because maybe it's them!

1357
01:46:13,047 --> 01:46:14,048
Maybe...

1358
01:46:15,883 --> 01:46:18,438
Maybe people aren't always good.

1359
01:46:19,511 --> 01:46:21,359
Ares or no Ares...

1360
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:25,975
...Maybe it's just,
who they are.

1361
01:46:28,911 --> 01:46:30,201
- Diana...
- No.

1362
01:46:30,533 --> 01:46:31,984
Diana, we can talk
about this later.

1363
01:46:32,189 --> 01:46:33,528
- I need you to come with me.
- No, no!

1364
01:46:33,529 --> 01:46:35,294
After everything I
saw, it can't be!

1365
01:46:35,518 --> 01:46:36,725
Can not be!

1366
01:46:37,474 --> 01:46:39,255
They were killing each other.

1367
01:46:39,507 --> 01:46:42,038
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1368
01:46:42,318 --> 01:46:43,904
Children!

1369
01:46:44,139 --> 01:46:46,484
No, it had to be him.
It can not be them!

1370
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:49,059
Diana, people... I...

1371
01:46:49,317 --> 01:46:50,861
She was right.

1372
01:46:51,388 --> 01:46:52,397
My mother was right.

1373
01:46:52,398 --> 01:46:54,442
She said the world of
men do not deserve you.

1374
01:46:54,644 --> 01:46:56,338
They don't deserve
our help, Steve.

1375
01:46:56,884 --> 01:46:59,141
- It's not about deserve!
- They do not deserve our help.

1376
01:46:59,166 --> 01:47:01,035
Maybe we don't!

1377
01:47:02,696 --> 01:47:04,864
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1378
01:47:05,861 --> 01:47:08,675
You don't think I get it, after
what I've seen out there?

1379
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:13,641
You don't think I wish I could tell
you that I was one bad guy to blame?

1380
01:47:14,472 --> 01:47:15,946
It's not!

1381
01:47:18,116 --> 01:47:19,796
We are all to blame.

1382
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:21,071
I am not.

1383
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,281
But maybe I am!

1384
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:29,159
Please.

1385
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,379
If you believe it.
This war should stop...

1386
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,196
...if you want to stop it...

1387
01:47:33,527 --> 01:47:35,270
...help me stop it right now.

1388
01:47:35,276 --> 01:47:36,277
Because...

1389
01:47:37,676 --> 01:47:42,980
If you don't, they will kill thousands
more. Please, please come with me.

1390
01:47:43,005 --> 01:47:44,488
I have to go.

1391
01:47:51,008 --> 01:47:52,621
I have to go.

1392
01:48:04,442 --> 01:48:05,478
Hey!

1393
01:48:10,011 --> 01:48:11,844
- Where is Diana?
- We are on our own.

1394
01:48:11,869 --> 01:48:14,280
- What?
- What do you see, Charlie?

1395
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,307
Seems like a bunch
of gas pumps...

1396
01:48:16,569 --> 01:48:18,902
...but I can't see where
they're taking them.

1397
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:20,539
How are we gonna get in there?

1398
01:48:21,271 --> 01:48:23,373
I have got an idea.
Come on guys.

1399
01:48:23,602 --> 01:48:24,603
Come on!

1400
01:48:38,503 --> 01:48:39,947
Who's there?

1401
01:48:52,618 --> 01:48:54,328
Sir Patrick.

1402
01:48:55,037 --> 01:48:59,368
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1403
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:04,395
They only deserve destruction.

1404
01:49:05,758 --> 01:49:07,226
You...

1405
01:49:08,899 --> 01:49:10,858
You are him.

1406
01:49:14,326 --> 01:49:15,730
I am.

1407
01:49:16,517 --> 01:49:20,742
But I'm not what
you thought I was.

1408
01:49:41,583 --> 01:49:42,948
What is that?

1409
01:49:44,241 --> 01:49:45,559
Future.

1410
01:49:50,273 --> 01:49:52,279
I'm not your enemy, Diana.

1411
01:49:54,309 --> 01:49:58,047
I'm the only one who
truly knows you.

1412
01:49:58,282 --> 01:50:02,806
And who truly knows
them, as you now do.

1413
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:08,791
They always been and
always will be...

1414
01:50:09,071 --> 01:50:12,931
...weak, cruel, selfish...

1415
01:50:12,979 --> 01:50:16,305
...and capable of the
greatest horrors.

1416
01:50:25,589 --> 01:50:27,039
All I ever wanted was...

1417
01:50:27,341 --> 01:50:32,098
...for the Gods to see how
evil my father's creation was.

1418
01:50:34,276 --> 01:50:35,721
But they refused.

1419
01:50:35,961 --> 01:50:37,247
I am Diana of Temiscira...

1420
01:50:37,248 --> 01:50:38,446
So I destroyed them.

1421
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:40,479
daughter of Hippolyta...

1422
01:50:40,717 --> 01:50:42,549
and I am here
to complete her...

1423
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,151
The God Killer...

1424
01:50:55,070 --> 01:50:57,092
My dear Child..

1425
01:50:58,419 --> 01:51:00,941
...that's not the God Killer.

1426
01:51:03,435 --> 01:51:04,936
You are.

1427
01:51:07,525 --> 01:51:10,663
Only a God can kill another God.

1428
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:15,604
Zeus left the child he had
with the queen of the Amazon.

1429
01:51:15,831 --> 01:51:18,104
...As a weapon to
use against me.

1430
01:51:18,129 --> 01:51:20,002
No. You liar.

1431
01:51:21,786 --> 01:51:24,099
I compel you to
tell me the truth.

1432
01:51:26,402 --> 01:51:27,889
I am.

1433
01:51:54,293 --> 01:51:56,639
I'm not the god of war, Diana.

1434
01:51:56,847 --> 01:51:59,315
I am the God of truth.

1435
01:52:00,848 --> 01:52:02,171
Mankind...

1436
01:52:02,805 --> 01:52:05,822
...Stole this world from us.

1437
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:11,326
They ruined it, day by day.

1438
01:52:11,327 --> 01:52:15,603
And I, the only one wise
enough to see it...

1439
01:52:17,059 --> 01:52:19,825
...was left too weak to stop them.

1440
01:52:20,752 --> 01:52:24,378
All these years I have
struggled alone...

1441
01:52:24,379 --> 01:52:26,531
...whispering into their ears.

1442
01:52:26,532 --> 01:52:31,351
Ideas, inspiration
for formulas...

1443
01:52:32,265 --> 01:52:33,861
...weapons...

1444
01:52:36,523 --> 01:52:39,060
...but I don't
make them use them.

1445
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:42,068
They start these
wars on their own.

1446
01:52:43,064 --> 01:52:46,882
All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep...

1447
01:52:47,156 --> 01:52:49,401
...in the hope they
will destroy themselves.

1448
01:52:51,459 --> 01:52:53,555
But it has never been enough.

1449
01:52:54,993 --> 01:52:56,092
Until you.

1450
01:52:58,742 --> 01:53:02,996
When you first arrived I
was going to crush you.

1451
01:53:03,574 --> 01:53:06,706
But I knew that if
only you could see...

1452
01:53:06,911 --> 01:53:10,783
...what the other
gods could not...

1453
01:53:12,157 --> 01:53:16,670
...then you would join me, and
with our powers combined...

1454
01:53:16,943 --> 01:53:20,875
...we could finally end all the
pain, all the suffering...

1455
01:53:21,096 --> 01:53:23,661
...destruction they bring.

1456
01:53:24,114 --> 01:53:29,247
And we could return this world to
the paradise it was before them.

1457
01:53:30,851 --> 01:53:32,581
Forever.

1458
01:53:35,472 --> 01:53:36,955
I...

1459
01:53:41,751 --> 01:53:44,485
I can never be a part of that.

1460
01:53:47,607 --> 01:53:50,383
My dear, I don't
want to fight you.

1461
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:52,763
But if I must...

1462
01:54:02,356 --> 01:54:04,211
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1463
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:05,984
Sammy, let's go!

1464
01:54:06,424 --> 01:54:07,912
Get these things out of here.

1465
01:54:37,847 --> 01:54:42,291
Oh my dear, you have
so much to learn.

1466
01:55:07,321 --> 01:55:09,806
Oh my God!

1467
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:11,707
What are we gonna do?

1468
01:55:13,465 --> 01:55:15,558
There is not much we can do...

1469
01:55:15,705 --> 01:55:17,334
...if that's who I think it is.

1470
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:25,058
But we can stop that plane.

1471
01:55:38,264 --> 01:55:40,160
If we could get on the radio...

1472
01:55:40,161 --> 01:55:42,746
...we can ask flying
corp to shoot her down.

1473
01:55:42,771 --> 01:55:46,047
No. If it crashes, it will wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles.

1474
01:55:46,072 --> 01:55:46,991
We gotta ground it!

1475
01:55:47,016 --> 01:55:48,807
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1476
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:51,267
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1477
01:55:58,301 --> 01:56:00,244
Is it flammable, Chief?

1478
01:56:00,269 --> 01:56:03,747
Yes, you said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1479
01:56:10,888 --> 01:56:13,318
I need you guys to clear
me a path to that plane.

1480
01:56:13,343 --> 01:56:15,495
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1481
01:56:17,517 --> 01:56:18,518
Come on!

1482
01:57:01,132 --> 01:57:03,556
Come on! This way! Steve!

1483
01:57:13,122 --> 01:57:14,969
- Come on, Steve.
- Ahead! Go!

1484
01:57:15,383 --> 01:57:16,857
Steve!

1485
01:57:59,775 --> 01:58:02,901
Let's see what kind of
god you really are.

1486
01:58:29,061 --> 01:58:32,705
You will help me
destroy them, Diana.

1487
01:58:36,013 --> 01:58:37,769
Or you will die.

1488
01:58:47,832 --> 01:58:50,184
Come on! Move, move, let's go!
Go. Go. Go.

1489
01:58:53,366 --> 01:58:55,364
- Now!
- Go! Run!

1490
01:59:20,424 --> 01:59:23,169
Is that all you have to offer?

1491
01:59:39,465 --> 01:59:43,386
It is futile to
imagine you can win.

1492
01:59:44,223 --> 01:59:45,932
Give up, Diana.

1493
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:51,622
Chief! Anything left?

1494
01:59:51,647 --> 01:59:52,582
I got nothing.

1495
01:59:52,607 --> 01:59:53,913
- Anything!
- No!

1496
02:00:11,753 --> 02:00:12,754
Steve.

1497
02:00:59,229 --> 02:01:00,681
Steve.

1498
02:01:03,730 --> 02:01:07,579
No!

1499
02:01:40,999 --> 02:01:43,401
Aye, Diana!

1500
02:01:43,803 --> 02:01:46,369
Take them all!

1501
02:01:46,714 --> 02:01:49,800
Finally you see.

1502
02:01:50,224 --> 02:01:52,799
Look at this world.

1503
02:01:53,098 --> 02:01:55,914
Mankind did this, not me.

1504
02:01:57,699 --> 02:01:59,772
They are ugly...

1505
02:01:59,797 --> 02:02:01,611
...filled with hatred...

1506
02:02:01,612 --> 02:02:02,995
...weak...

1507
02:02:02,996 --> 02:02:06,120
...Just like your
captain Trevor.

1508
02:02:06,688 --> 02:02:12,402
Gone and left you nothing.
And for what?

1509
02:02:12,789 --> 02:02:14,374
Pathetic!

1510
02:02:15,748 --> 02:02:17,491
They deserved to burn!

1511
02:02:28,201 --> 02:02:32,637
Look at her and
tell me I'm wrong.

1512
02:02:41,044 --> 02:02:45,043
She is the perfect example
of these humans...

1513
02:02:46,799 --> 02:02:50,706
...and unworthy of your
sympathy in every way.

1514
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:54,357
Destroy her, Diana.

1515
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:58,799
You know that she deserves.
That they all do.

1516
02:03:02,021 --> 02:03:03,382
Do it!

1517
02:03:08,190 --> 02:03:09,892
Diana!

1518
02:03:13,101 --> 02:03:14,535
Diana...

1519
02:03:24,065 --> 02:03:25,066
What?

1520
02:03:25,566 --> 02:03:27,170
We have to go.

1521
02:03:29,916 --> 02:03:31,409
What are you saying?

1522
02:03:31,975 --> 02:03:33,021
Steve...

1523
02:03:33,853 --> 02:03:35,985
...Whatever it is, I can do it.

1524
02:03:36,311 --> 02:03:37,159
No.. No..

1525
02:03:37,286 --> 02:03:38,675
- Let me do it.
- No.

1526
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:40,552
It has to be me.

1527
02:03:40,577 --> 02:03:42,231
It has to be me.

1528
02:03:42,551 --> 02:03:45,799
I could save today.
You can save the world.

1529
02:03:54,617 --> 02:03:57,057
I wish we had more time.

1530
02:03:57,302 --> 02:04:00,081
What?
What are you saying?

1531
02:04:02,989 --> 02:04:03,990
I love you!

1532
02:04:15,932 --> 02:04:17,415
You are wrong about them.

1533
02:04:27,187 --> 02:04:28,850
They are everything you say...

1534
02:04:29,718 --> 02:04:31,307
...but so much more.

1535
02:04:31,577 --> 02:04:32,874
Lies!

1536
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:02,750
They do not deserve
your protection!

1537
02:05:04,526 --> 02:05:05,613
It's not about deserving.

1538
02:05:10,488 --> 02:05:12,392
It's about what you believe.

1539
02:05:16,028 --> 02:05:17,408
And I believe in love.

1540
02:05:17,442 --> 02:05:22,689
Then I will destroy you!

1541
02:05:49,907 --> 02:05:51,636
<i>Goodbye brother.</i>

1542
02:09:23,804 --> 02:09:26,197
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

1543
02:09:27,286 --> 02:09:31,027
<i>To end war and bring
peace to mankind.</i>

1544
02:09:31,781 --> 02:09:35,656
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their mind</i>

1545
02:09:36,505 --> 02:09:38,770
<i>...and learned that inside
every one of them...</i>

1546
02:09:39,485 --> 02:09:41,771
<i>...there will always be both.</i>

1547
02:09:42,477 --> 02:09:45,333
<i>A choice each must
make for themselves.</i>

1548
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:49,029
<i>Something no hero
will ever defeat..</i>

1549
02:09:50,375 --> 02:09:51,619
<i>And now I know...</i>

1550
02:09:52,791 --> 02:09:57,334
<i>...that only love can
truly save the world.</i>

1551
02:09:58,656 --> 02:10:00,759
<i>So I stay...</i>

1552
02:10:01,026 --> 02:10:03,180
<i>...I fight and I give...</i>

1553
02:10:06,168 --> 02:10:08,144
<i>...for the world I know can be.</i>

1554
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:14,388
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1555
02:10:17,259 --> 02:10:18,602
<i>Forever.</i>
