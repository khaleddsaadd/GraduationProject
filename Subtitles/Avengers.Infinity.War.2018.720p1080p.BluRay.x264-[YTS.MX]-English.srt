00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,295
<i>This is the Asgardian</i>

00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:30,766
<i>refugee vessel</i> Statesman.

4
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:34,770
<i>We are under assault.</i>

5
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:37,170
<i>I repeat,
we are under assault.</i>

6
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:40,740
<i>The engines are dead,
life support failing.</i>

7
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:44,044
<i>Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.</i>

8
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:48,048
<i>We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.</i>

9
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,617
<i>Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.</i>

10
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,352
<i>We have
very few soldiers here.</i>

11
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:54,321
<i>This is not a warcraft.</i>

12
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:56,325
<i>I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.</i>

13
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:12,708
Hear me and rejoice.

14
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:18,812
You have had the privilege

15
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:21,550
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,688
You may think
this is suffering.

17
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,056
No.

18
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,361
It is salvation.

19
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:40,099
Universal scales
tip toward balance

20
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,703
because of your sacrifice.

21
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:44,805
Smile.

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,274
For even in death,

23
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:50,646
you have become
Children of Thanos.

24
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,229
I know what it's like to lose.

25
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,334
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

26
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,738
yet to fail, nonetheless.

27
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,514
It's frightening.

28
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:29,751
Turns the legs to jelly.

29
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:34,155
But I ask you, to what end?

30
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,159
Dread it, run from it...

31
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,629
destiny arrives all the same.

32
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,665
And now, it's here.

33
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,201
Or should I say...

34
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,104
I am.

35
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,711
You talk too much.

36
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:59,812
The Tesseract.

37
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:02,116
Or your brother's head.

38
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,156
I assume you have
a preference.

39
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,657
Oh, I do.

40
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,129
Kill away.

41
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,445
All right, stop!

42
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,216
We don't have the Tesseract.

43
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,853
It was destroyed on Asgard.

44
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,600
You really are
the worst brother.

45
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,705
I assure you, brother...

46
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,775
the sun will shine
on us again.

47
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,912
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.

48
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:11,016
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

49
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,218
And for another...

50
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,821
we have a Hulk.

51
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,805
Let him have his fun.

52
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,623
Allfathers...

53
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,728
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

54
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,663
time.

55
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,913
That was a mistake.

56
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,554
No!

57
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,366
You're going to die for that.

58
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,637
Shh.

59
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,378
My humble personage...

60
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,949
bows before your grandeur.

61
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,887
No other being
has ever had the might...

62
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,923
nay, the nobility...

63
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:36,696
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

64
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,603
The universe lies
within your grasp.

65
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,612
There are two more stones
on Earth.

66
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,815
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

67
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,483
Father,
we will not fail you.

68
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,019
If I might interject.

69
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:40,191
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

70
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,026
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

71
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:45,528
If you consider
failure experience.

72
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,133
I consider
experience experience.

73
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,134
Almighty Thanos...

74
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:55,874
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

75
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:00,879
Odinson...

76
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:06,752
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...

77
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,154
god of mischief...

78
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:11,657
do hereby pledge to you...

79
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:16,895
my undying fidelity.

80
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,941
Undying?

81
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,946
You should choose your words
more carefully.

82
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:57,936
You...

83
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:00,705
will never be...

84
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,575
a god.

85
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:15,820
No!

86
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:33,205
No resurrections this time.

87
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:59,030
No. Loki.

88
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:40,936
<i>Seriously,
you don't have any money?</i>

89
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:44,106
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

90
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:45,674
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.

91
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:47,709
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

92
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:49,711
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

93
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:50,846
Dollars?

94
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:52,782
- Rupees.
- Which is?

95
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,249
Uh, buck and a half.

96
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:56,118
What do you want?

97
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,255
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

98
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:12,804
Thanos is coming.

99
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,637
He's coming.

100
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:20,010
Who?

101
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:30,152
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

102
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,320
You're totally rambling.

103
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:32,254
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

104
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:33,688
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

105
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,922
and in the dream
you gotta pee.

106
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,058
- Yeah.
- Okay.

107
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,025
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.

108
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:38,427
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

109
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:39,694
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

110
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:40,762
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."

111
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:41,896
And then you wake up
and in real life

112
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:42,997
you actually have to pee.

113
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,066
- Yes.
- Yeah.

114
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,300
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

115
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:47,336
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

116
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:51,342
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

117
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:53,475
It was so real.

118
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:55,009
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

119
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:56,144
Uh, what was his name?

120
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:58,480
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

121
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:00,315
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

122
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:02,116
...and thought that we were...

123
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,285
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

124
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,152
- Yes?
- No.

125
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:05,987
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

126
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:07,989
If you wanted to have a kid...

127
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:10,057
you wouldn't have done that.

128
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:12,093
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

129
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,762
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

130
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,163
You're not helping
your case, okay?

131
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,398
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

132
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,232
You don't need that.

133
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:19,368
I know, I had the surgery.

134
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,769
I'm just
trying to protect us...

135
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:22,404
and future usses
and that's it.

136
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:24,138
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.

137
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,075
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

138
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:29,243
You know me so well.

139
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:32,447
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

140
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,350
You should have shirts
in your closet.

141
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:36,518
Yeah.

142
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,419
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

143
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:39,921
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

144
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:42,056
Show off this Harry Winston.

145
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:44,458
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

146
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,826
I should promise you.

147
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:47,063
- Yes.
- I will.

148
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:50,531
Thank you.

149
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,732
Tony Stark.

150
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:55,004
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

151
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:59,808
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

152
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,777
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

153
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,945
We need your help.

154
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,479
It's not overselling it
to say that

155
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,281
the fate of the universe
is at stake.

156
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:08,818
And who's "we"?

157
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:11,787
Hey, Tony.

158
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:12,920
Bruce.

159
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,424
- Pepper.
- Hi.

160
00:13:17,427 --> 00:13:19,128
- Oh.
- You okay?

161
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:23,164
At the dawn
of the universe,

162
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,134
there was nothing. Then...

163
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:27,301
Boom.

164
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:30,905
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

165
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:33,776
hurtling across
the virgin universe.

166
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:36,310
These Infinity Stones

167
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:39,249
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

168
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:41,351
Space.

169
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:43,786
Reality.

170
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:46,422
Power.

171
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,924
Soul.

172
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,160
Mind.

173
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:54,297
And Time.

174
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:05,239
Tell me his name again.

175
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:06,540
Thanos.

176
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,041
He's a plague, Tony.

177
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:10,076
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

178
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:12,313
He wipes out
half the population.

179
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,582
He sent Loki.

180
00:14:14,584 --> 00:14:17,520
The attack on New York,
that's him.

181
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:19,288
This is it.

182
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:21,389
What's our timeline?

183
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:23,990
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

184
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:24,924
That already makes him

185
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,627
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

186
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:30,163
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

187
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:31,298
He could destroy life

188
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,467
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

189
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:35,469
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

190
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:37,638
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

191
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,274
Is that what it is?

192
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:43,979
I'm going to allow that.

193
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,581
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

194
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,215
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

195
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:50,450
No can do.

196
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:53,253
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

197
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:54,521
And I swore off dairy...

198
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:57,157
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.

199
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,659
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

200
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:00,293
A bit chalky.

201
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:02,062
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

202
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:03,229
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

203
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:04,331
Point is, things change.

204
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,434
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

205
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:09,602
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

206
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:10,503
Yeah, so conversely,

207
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:12,639
it may also be
his best chance against us.

208
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:14,274
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

209
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:15,342
What is your job exactly?

210
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:17,045
Besides making
balloon animals.

211
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:20,914
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.

212
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,450
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

213
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:25,418
The fact is
we have this stone.

214
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,153
We know where it is.

215
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:29,556
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

216
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:31,326
and we have to find him now.

217
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,560
Yeah, that's the thing.

218
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:34,561
What do you mean?

219
00:15:34,563 --> 00:15:37,097
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

220
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,264
He's offline.

221
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,599
- What?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:41,668
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

223
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,204
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

224
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:45,574
Who could find Vision then?

225
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:50,310
Shit.

226
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:51,444
Probably Steve Rogers.

227
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:52,581
Oh, great.

228
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:54,316
Maybe.

229
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:56,016
But...

230
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:00,489
Call him.

231
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:03,590
It's not that easy.

232
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,558
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

233
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,626
No.

234
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,363
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

235
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:10,131
Broke up?

236
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,099
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?

237
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:16,036
Cap and I fell out hard.

238
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:18,172
We're not on speaking terms.

239
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,143
Tony, listen to me.

240
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,479
Thor's gone.

241
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:27,279
Thanos is coming.

242
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:29,150
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

243
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,368
Flip phone.

244
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:09,689
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be

245
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:11,025
moving your hair, would ya?

246
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,226
Not at the moment, no.

247
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:48,596
You okay?

248
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:50,829
- Help him!
- Banner!

249
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:52,631
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

250
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:53,699
Friday, what am I looking at?

251
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,334
<i>Not sure.
I'm working on it.</i>

252
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,436
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

253
00:17:57,438 --> 00:17:58,737
in your back pocket, Doc!

254
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:00,107
Might wanna use it.

255
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:29,835
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

256
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:31,570
Holy shit.

257
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:33,271
We're all gonna die!

258
00:18:33,273 --> 00:18:34,573
There's a spaceship!

259
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:36,408
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

260
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:46,117
What's the matter
with you kids?

261
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,755
You never seen
a spaceship before?

262
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,500
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

263
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:03,635
Notify first responders.

264
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:04,773
<i>Will do.</i>

265
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:36,202
Hear me and rejoice.

266
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:38,937
You are about to die

267
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:41,238
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

268
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,809
Be thankful...

269
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:46,744
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

270
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:49,680
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.

271
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:52,583
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

272
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:54,652
Stonekeeper.

273
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:57,188
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

274
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,390
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

275
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:01,728
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

276
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,428
He means get lost, Squidward.

277
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,630
He exhausts me.

278
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:07,732
Bring me the stone.

279
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:10,737
Banner, you want a piece?

280
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:13,304
Mmm, no, not really.

281
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:14,672
But when do I ever get
what I want?

282
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:15,675
That's right.

283
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:17,742
Okay. Push!

284
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:19,443
It's been a while.

285
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:20,978
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

286
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,145
Okay. Shh.

287
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:24,982
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

288
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,484
Come on, come on, man.

289
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,688
God!

290
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,254
Where's your guy?

291
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,958
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

292
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,326
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

293
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:36,848
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

294
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,069
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

295
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:47,337
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

296
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:48,304
It's okay.

297
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:50,841
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

298
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:52,310
- I have him.
- Damn it.

299
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:21,337
Where'd that come from?

300
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:22,405
<i>It's nanotech.</i>

301
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,807
<i>You like it?
A little something I...</i>

302
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,579
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend

303
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,782
won't be joining us...

304
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,792
<i>Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.</i>

305
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:43,293
It stays with me.

306
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:44,296
Exactly. Bye.

307
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:55,405
Tony, you okay?

308
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:57,440
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- <i>Really, really good.</i>

309
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,675
<i>Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?</i>

310
00:21:58,677 --> 00:21:59,911
I'm trying. He won't come out.

311
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:02,881
<i>Hammer.</i>

312
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:13,723
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

313
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:15,959
Come out! Come out! Come out!

314
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,330
No!

315
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:23,869
What do you mean, "no"?

316
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,508
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

317
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,346
- <i>Kid, where'd you come from?</i>
- A field trip to MoMA.

318
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:38,021
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

319
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:39,749
Uh, he's from space.

320
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:41,985
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

321
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:10,580
Your powers are quaint.

322
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:12,383
You must be popular
with children.

323
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:17,120
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

324
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:19,555
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

325
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:37,539
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.

326
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,175
You'll only wish
you were dead.

327
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:50,487
No!

328
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,159
<i>Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.</i>

329
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:57,796
On it!

330
00:24:05,136 --> 00:24:06,637
Not cool.

331
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:11,842
Gotcha!

332
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,011
Wait!

333
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:24,853
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.

334
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:26,090
<i>Hang on, kid.</i>

335
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,140
Oh!

336
00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:46,041
Ugh.

337
00:24:46,043 --> 00:24:47,845
<i>Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.</i>

338
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:56,686
Give me a little juice,
Friday.

339
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:06,929
Unlock 17:A.

340
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:21,710
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

341
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:24,079
But you said
save the wizard!

342
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:25,180
I can't breathe.

343
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:28,052
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

344
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:31,221
Yeah. That makes sense.

345
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:50,705
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

346
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:51,706
<i>Happy trails, kid.</i>

347
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,229
<i>- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.</i>

348
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:55,678
Oh, come on!

349
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,154
<i>Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.</i>

350
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:07,189
<i>Tony? Oh, my God.</i>

351
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,256
<i>Are you all right?
What's going on?</i>

352
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:09,324
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think</i>

353
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,159
<i>we might have to push
our 8:30 res.</i>

354
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:12,294
<i>Why?</i>

355
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:13,961
<i>Just 'cause
I'll probably</i>

356
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:16,564
<i>not make it back for a while.</i>

357
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:17,832
<i>Tell me
you're not on that ship.</i>

358
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:19,101
Yeah.

359
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:20,302
<i>God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.</i>

360
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:22,104
Honey, I'm sorry.

361
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:23,138
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

362
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,839
<i>Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.</i>

363
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:27,008
- Pep.
- <i>Come back here right now.</i>

364
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,042
<i>Come back.</i>

365
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,811
<i>Boss,
we're losing her.</i>

366
00:26:30,813 --> 00:26:32,249
<i>I'm going too.</i>

367
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:42,725
Oh, my God!

368
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:49,065
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

369
00:27:03,346 --> 00:27:05,079
Where you going?

370
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,714
The Time Stone's been taken.

371
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:08,651
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

372
00:27:09,152 --> 00:27:10,720
What will you do?

373
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:13,089
I'm gonna make a call.

374
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:54,663
Sing it, Drax!

375
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,776
Why are we doing this again?

376
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:10,344
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.

377
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:11,678
Someone could be dying.

378
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,880
I get that,
but why are we doing it?

379
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:15,849
'Cause we're nice.

380
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:16,916
And maybe whoever it is

381
00:28:16,918 --> 00:28:18,786
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.

382
00:28:18,788 --> 00:28:21,188
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

383
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,090
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...

384
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:24,258
We take his ship.

385
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,060
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

386
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:27,063
All right!

387
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,199
We are arriving.

388
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:33,267
All right, Guardians,

389
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:34,701
don't forget
this might be dangerous...

390
00:28:34,703 --> 00:28:36,938
so let's put on
our mean faces.

391
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:43,843
Groot, put that
thing away, now.

392
00:28:43,845 --> 00:28:44,911
I don't wanna tell you again.

393
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:46,146
Groot.

394
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:47,314
I am Groot!

395
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:48,415
- Whoa!
- Language!

396
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:50,016
- Hey!
- Wow.

397
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:51,885
You got some
acorns on you, kid.

398
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:53,387
Ever since
you got a little sap,

399
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:55,356
you're a total d-hole.

400
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,760
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

401
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:07,135
What happened?

402
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:12,441
Oh, my God.

403
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:19,915
Looks like
we're not getting paid.

404
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:24,217
Wipers! Wipers!

405
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:25,453
Get it off.

406
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:35,128
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

407
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,096
He is not a dude.

408
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,998
You're a dude.

409
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,335
This... This is a man.

410
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:45,271
A handsome, muscular man.

411
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:46,339
I'm muscular.

412
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:47,407
But who are you
kidding, Quill?

413
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:48,975
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

414
00:29:48,977 --> 00:29:49,976
Yeah, right.

415
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:51,511
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

416
00:29:51,513 --> 00:29:52,713
What?

417
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,818
Gamora, do you think I'm...

418
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:02,855
He is anxious, angry.

419
00:30:02,857 --> 00:30:06,459
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

420
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:09,329
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

421
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:10,296
Wow.

422
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:12,498
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

423
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,401
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

424
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:16,469
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

425
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:18,104
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

426
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:19,339
It's like his muscles

427
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:21,407
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.

428
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:23,178
Stop massaging his muscles.

429
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:26,014
Wake him up.

430
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:30,350
Wake.

431
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:49,970
Who the hell are you guys?

432
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:56,442
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

433
00:30:56,444 --> 00:30:58,278
To bring balance
to the universe

434
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,347
by wiping out
half of all life.

435
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:03,583
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

436
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:05,317
massacre by massacre.

437
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,952
Including my own.

438
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:08,554
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

439
00:31:08,556 --> 00:31:11,923
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

440
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:14,527
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

441
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:18,365
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

442
00:31:22,403 --> 00:31:24,471
Your father killed my brother.

443
00:31:24,938 --> 00:31:26,238
Oh, boy.

444
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,106
Stepfather, technically.

445
00:31:28,108 --> 00:31:30,044
And she hates him
as much as you do.

446
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:35,380
Families can be tough.

447
00:31:35,382 --> 00:31:36,915
Before my father died,

448
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,651
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

449
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:41,186
that he imprisoned in Hel.

450
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:44,289
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

451
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,658
So I had to kill her.

452
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,959
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

453
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:49,163
Goes round and round and...

454
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,163
I feel your pain.

455
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:53,532
I feel your pain as well,
because...

456
00:31:53,534 --> 00:31:54,933
I mean,
it's not a competition,

457
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:56,168
but I've been through a lot.

458
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,036
My father killed my mother.

459
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:59,204
And then I had to kill
my father.

460
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:00,939
That was hard.

461
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:04,276
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

462
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:07,312
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

463
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:09,083
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

464
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:14,453
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

465
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:17,155
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

466
00:32:17,157 --> 00:32:20,525
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

467
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:23,230
No, you're not.

468
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:29,468
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

469
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,972
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

470
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,541
- No.
- You are.

471
00:32:36,543 --> 00:32:39,444
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

472
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:40,945
No, I'm not.

473
00:32:40,947 --> 00:32:42,949
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

474
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:50,455
Are you mocking me?

475
00:32:50,457 --> 00:32:53,991
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

476
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:55,059
He's trying to copy me.

477
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:56,193
I need you to stop doing that.

478
00:32:56,195 --> 00:32:58,028
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

479
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,464
We need to stop Thanos.

480
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:01,165
Which means
we need to find out

481
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,300
where he's going next.

482
00:33:02,302 --> 00:33:03,635
Knowhere.

483
00:33:03,637 --> 00:33:05,504
He must be going somewhere.

484
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,639
No, no. Knowhere?

485
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,509
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

486
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:13,378
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

487
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,648
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

488
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,115
Because for years...

489
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:20,317
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

490
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,986
with a man
called the Collector.

491
00:33:21,988 --> 00:33:23,588
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

492
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,490
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

493
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:27,124
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

494
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:29,694
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

495
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:32,329
There are six stones
out there.

496
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:34,633
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

497
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:38,436
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

498
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:40,605
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

499
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:43,474
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

500
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:45,242
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

501
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:46,510
They're with the Avengers.

502
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:49,046
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

503
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:50,281
Like Kevin Bacon?

504
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:51,582
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

505
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:52,650
I haven't been there
in a while.

506
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:55,219
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

507
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,054
No one even knows where it is.

508
00:33:57,056 --> 00:33:58,723
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

509
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:00,424
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

510
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:03,093
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

511
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:04,261
You're welcome.

512
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:05,563
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

513
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:09,667
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

514
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:11,669
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

515
00:34:11,671 --> 00:34:15,072
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

516
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:16,707
That place is a legend.

517
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,309
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

518
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:20,478
to ever torment the universe.

519
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,646
I would very much like
to go there, please.

520
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:23,714
The rabbit is correct

521
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:24,815
and clearly the smartest
among you.

522
00:34:24,817 --> 00:34:25,850
Rabbit?

523
00:34:25,852 --> 00:34:28,519
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

524
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:29,820
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

525
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,155
You're very perceptive.

526
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:32,389
You seem like a noble leader.

527
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:34,191
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

528
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:37,161
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

529
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:39,096
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

530
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:40,264
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

531
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,465
Quiet.

532
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:43,133
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

533
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:44,769
Look, this is my ship.

534
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:47,571
And I'm not goin' to...

535
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:49,774
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

536
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:51,842
The Thanos-killing kind.

537
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:53,577
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

538
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,746
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

539
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:57,080
Your bodies would crumble

540
00:34:57,082 --> 00:34:58,349
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

541
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:00,417
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

542
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:01,685
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

543
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:03,152
If we don't go to Knowhere

544
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:04,755
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

545
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:06,524
he'll be too powerful to stop.

546
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:08,793
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

547
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,628
We got two ships

548
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,262
and a large assortment
of morons.

549
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:15,599
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

550
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:16,801
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

551
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:18,602
to try to stop Thanos.

552
00:35:18,604 --> 00:35:20,671
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

553
00:35:20,673 --> 00:35:22,706
For the record...

554
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,240
I know that
you're going with him

555
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:25,442
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

556
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:27,110
You know, you really shouldn't

557
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:29,214
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

558
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:31,882
Come on, Groot.

559
00:35:31,884 --> 00:35:34,718
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

560
00:35:38,423 --> 00:35:41,424
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

561
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:42,527
Bye.

562
00:35:57,342 --> 00:35:58,810
Vis?

563
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:00,878
Is it the stone again?

564
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,581
It's as if
it's speaking to me.

565
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:05,784
What does it say?

566
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:08,253
I don't... I don't know,
but something.

567
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:11,623
Hey.

568
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:24,102
Tell me what you feel.

569
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:33,678
I just feel you.

570
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,886
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...

571
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:46,222
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

572
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:47,724
What if
I miss that train?

573
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:48,858
There's an 11:00.

574
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,396
What if I missed
all the trains?

575
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:54,597
What if this time
I didn't go back?

576
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,199
But you gave Stark your word.

577
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:57,367
I'd rather give it to you.

578
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:59,569
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

579
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:00,970
We both made promises.

580
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:02,741
Not to each other.

581
00:37:03,274 --> 00:37:05,241
Wanda.

582
00:37:05,243 --> 00:37:07,644
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

583
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:09,812
trying to see
if this could work and...

584
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:11,614
I don't know.

585
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:13,650
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

586
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:15,618
I think...

587
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,819
- It works.
- It works.

588
00:37:16,821 --> 00:37:18,255
It works.

589
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:21,826
Stay.

590
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:24,496
Stay with me.

591
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:32,504
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

592
00:37:39,544 --> 00:37:41,611
What are they?

593
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:43,948
What the stone
was warning me about.

594
00:37:53,925 --> 00:37:55,457
I have to go.

595
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:56,959
No, Vision.

596
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:58,427
Vision, if that's true,

597
00:37:58,429 --> 00:38:01,265
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.

598
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:03,498
Wanda, I...

599
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,536
Vision!

600
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:37,332
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.

601
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:39,335
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

602
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,871
My systems are failing.

603
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:45,609
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

604
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:49,246
Vis!

605
00:38:58,322 --> 00:39:01,690
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

606
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,898
Hands off.

607
00:39:56,747 --> 00:39:58,079
Come on. Come on.

608
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:00,048
Come on, you gotta get up.

609
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,418
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

610
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:05,120
Hey. We have to go.

611
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:09,523
Please. Please leave.

612
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:11,360
You asked me to stay.

613
00:40:12,562 --> 00:40:13,696
- I'm staying.
- Please.

614
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:26,768
- Get up.
- I can't.

615
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,670
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

616
00:41:29,672 --> 00:41:31,808
You'll never get
the chance again.

617
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,690
Can you stand?

618
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,564
Thank you, Captain.

619
00:41:58,134 --> 00:41:59,835
Let's get you on the jet.

620
00:42:03,807 --> 00:42:07,274
Now, I thought we had a deal.

621
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:11,178
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

622
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,781
I'm sorry.

623
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:14,616
We just wanted time.

624
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:18,586
Where to, Cap?

625
00:42:21,257 --> 00:42:22,858
Home.

626
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:28,628
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

627
00:42:53,022 --> 00:42:54,188
<i>Zehobereians.</i>

628
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,123
Mother! Where's my mother?

629
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,724
<i>Choose a side or die.</i>

630
00:42:57,726 --> 00:42:59,226
Mother!

631
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:01,694
<i>One side
is a revelation...</i>

632
00:43:01,696 --> 00:43:04,733
<i>the other an honor
known only to a few.</i>

633
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,734
What's wrong, little one?

634
00:43:07,736 --> 00:43:11,072
My mother. Where is my mother?

635
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,078
What's your name?

636
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,680
Gamora.

637
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,785
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.

638
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,718
Come.

639
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,721
Let me help you.

640
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:41,236
Look.

641
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:47,306
Pretty, isn't it?

642
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:51,010
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

643
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:54,816
Too much to one side
or the other...

644
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,689
Here. You try.

645
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:08,562
<i>Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.</i>

646
00:44:09,964 --> 00:44:11,833
Uh-uh.

647
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:15,268
Concentrate.

648
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:21,009
There. You've got it.

649
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,685
Gamora.

650
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,820
Do you know if these grenades

651
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:36,155
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

652
00:44:36,157 --> 00:44:37,290
Because I was thinking about

653
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:39,025
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

654
00:44:39,027 --> 00:44:40,159
But I don't want to
if they're the...

655
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:41,362
I need to ask a favor.

656
00:44:42,297 --> 00:44:43,765
Yeah, sure.

657
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,332
One way or another,

658
00:44:46,334 --> 00:44:48,735
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.

659
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:52,871
Which is what
the grenades are for.

660
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:55,143
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?

661
00:44:57,412 --> 00:44:58,612
If things go wrong...

662
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,217
If Thanos gets me...

663
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:08,822
I want you to promise me...

664
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:10,958
you'll kill me.

665
00:45:11,758 --> 00:45:12,759
What?

666
00:45:15,896 --> 00:45:18,199
I know something he doesn't.

667
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:23,068
And if he finds it out,

668
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,510
the entire universe
could be at risk.

669
00:45:25,105 --> 00:45:26,305
What do you know?

670
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,343
If I tell you, you'd know too.

671
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:33,312
If it's so important...

672
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,480
shouldn't I?

673
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:35,647
Only if you wanna die.

674
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,769
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

675
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,987
Just...

676
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:45,458
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.

677
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,059
I mean, I'd like to.

678
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:50,061
I really would. But you...

679
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:51,231
Swear to me.

680
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,070
Swear to me on your mother.

681
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:05,078
Okay.

682
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:12,252
Okay.

683
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:29,534
- Oh.
- Dude.

684
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,236
How long have you been
standing there?

685
00:46:31,238 --> 00:46:32,239
An hour.

686
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,074
An hour?

687
00:46:34,508 --> 00:46:36,074
Are you serious?

688
00:46:36,076 --> 00:46:38,276
I've mastered the ability

689
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:41,014
of standing
so incredibly still...

690
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:44,851
that I become
invisible to the eye.

691
00:46:45,352 --> 00:46:46,353
Watch.

692
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,324
You're eating a zarg-nut.

693
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:53,859
But my movement...

694
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:56,230
was so slow...

695
00:46:57,097 --> 00:46:59,097
that it's imperceptible.

696
00:46:59,099 --> 00:46:59,965
Mmm, no.

697
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,567
I'm sure I'm invisible.

698
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,903
Hi, Drax.

699
00:47:06,473 --> 00:47:07,474
Damn it.

700
00:47:27,394 --> 00:47:29,327
This place looks deserted.

701
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:32,264
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

702
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,200
Yep,
I'm picking that up too.

703
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:37,103
Let's put down right here.

704
00:47:48,914 --> 00:47:50,350
I don't have it.

705
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,285
Everyone
in the galaxy knows

706
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:55,953
you'd sell your own brother...

707
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:57,589
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

708
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:59,526
to your pathetic collection.

709
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:10,868
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

710
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,240
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

711
00:48:17,443 --> 00:48:19,111
I told you.

712
00:48:19,945 --> 00:48:20,946
I sold it.

713
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,983
Why would I lie?

714
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:28,154
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

715
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:30,921
Like suicide.

716
00:48:30,923 --> 00:48:33,290
You do understand.

717
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:36,427
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

718
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:38,228
I didn't know what it was.

719
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,198
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

720
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,333
It's him.

721
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:43,967
Last chance,
charlatan.

722
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:47,438
Where's the stone?

723
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,972
Today...

724
00:48:48,974 --> 00:48:50,074
Drax. Drax.

725
00:48:50,076 --> 00:48:52,142
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

726
00:48:52,144 --> 00:48:53,179
Drax, wait.

727
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,213
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

728
00:48:56,215 --> 00:48:57,416
Drax.

729
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,654
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

730
00:49:03,656 --> 00:49:06,190
He doesn't have the stone yet.

731
00:49:06,192 --> 00:49:08,559
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

732
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:12,029
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

733
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:13,230
No.

734
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:16,633
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

735
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:18,070
Sleep.

736
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:31,147
Okay.

737
00:49:31,149 --> 00:49:35,221
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

738
00:49:36,522 --> 00:49:37,922
The other right.

739
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,948
Why?

740
00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:17,996
Why you, daughter?

741
00:50:36,514 --> 00:50:37,515
That was quick.

742
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:48,259
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

743
00:50:50,528 --> 00:50:53,298
<i>Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?</i>

744
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:59,003
<i>In my heart,
I knew you still cared.</i>

745
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:09,514
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

746
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,559
<i>Reality is often
disappointing.</i>

747
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:27,098
That is, it was.

748
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:30,435
Now...

749
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:35,273
reality can be
whatever I want.

750
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:38,407
You knew I'd come.

751
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:40,743
I counted on it.

752
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:43,681
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

753
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:50,153
Thanos!

754
00:51:57,629 --> 00:51:58,663
No!

755
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:05,200
Let her go, Grimace.

756
00:52:05,202 --> 00:52:06,203
Peter.

757
00:52:07,572 --> 00:52:08,774
I told you to go right.

758
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,873
Now? Really?

759
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:12,742
You let her go!

760
00:52:12,744 --> 00:52:14,644
Ah, the boyfriend.

761
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:15,779
No.

762
00:52:15,781 --> 00:52:17,178
Like to think of myself

763
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,682
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

764
00:52:19,684 --> 00:52:21,851
- Let her go.
- Peter.

765
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:26,624
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

766
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:28,693
Not him.

767
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:42,840
You promised. You promised.

768
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:48,710
Oh, daughter.

769
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:51,315
You expect too much from him.

770
00:52:54,787 --> 00:52:56,453
She's asked, hasn't she?

771
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:01,425
Do it.

772
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:06,496
Mmm.

773
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:09,232
Do it!

774
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,374
I told you to go right.

775
00:53:19,343 --> 00:53:22,312
I love you more than anything.

776
00:53:25,415 --> 00:53:26,817
I love you too.

777
00:53:41,264 --> 00:53:42,299
I like him.

778
00:54:12,797 --> 00:54:14,929
<i>Still no word from Vision?</i>

779
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:18,332
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

780
00:54:18,334 --> 00:54:19,567
<i>On a stolen Quinjet</i>

781
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:21,636
<i>with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.</i>

782
00:54:21,638 --> 00:54:23,370
You know they're
only criminals because

783
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:24,906
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?

784
00:54:24,908 --> 00:54:26,041
<i>My God, Rhodes.</i>

785
00:54:26,043 --> 00:54:29,644
<i>Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.</i>

786
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:30,812
If it weren't
for those Accords,

787
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:32,914
Vision would've been
right here.

788
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:36,285
<i>I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.</i>

789
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:37,687
That's right.

790
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,690
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

791
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:42,991
<i>You have second thoughts?</i>

792
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:44,762
Not anymore.

793
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:52,301
Mr. Secretary.

794
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:58,474
<i>You got some nerve.</i>

795
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:00,842
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

796
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:02,645
You could use
some of that right now.

797
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:06,547
<i>The world's on fire.</i>

798
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:10,284
<i>And you think all is forgiven?</i>

799
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:12,053
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

800
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:14,356
And I'm way past
asking permission.

801
00:55:16,325 --> 00:55:18,759
Earth just lost
her best defender.

802
00:55:18,762 --> 00:55:19,929
So we're here to fight.

803
00:55:21,597 --> 00:55:23,532
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

804
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:26,469
we'll fight you too.

805
00:55:29,672 --> 00:55:30,673
<i>Arrest them.</i>

806
00:55:31,775 --> 00:55:33,442
All over it.

807
00:55:38,514 --> 00:55:39,815
That's a court-martial.

808
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:43,464
It's great to see you, Cap.

809
00:55:44,487 --> 00:55:46,353
You too, Rhodey.

810
00:55:46,355 --> 00:55:47,356
Hey.

811
00:55:48,624 --> 00:55:50,860
Wow. You guys...

812
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:53,861
really look like crap.

813
00:55:53,863 --> 00:55:55,662
Must've been
a rough couple years.

814
00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:58,767
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

815
00:55:58,769 --> 00:56:00,903
Uh, I think
you look great.

816
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:05,441
Uh...

817
00:56:07,977 --> 00:56:10,012
Yeah, I'm back.

818
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:12,748
Hi, Bruce.

819
00:56:18,386 --> 00:56:19,387
Nat.

820
00:56:22,725 --> 00:56:24,359
This is awkward.

821
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:28,529
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

822
00:56:28,531 --> 00:56:29,798
And they can clearly find us.

823
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,398
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

824
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,867
After the whole
Accords situation,

825
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:35,602
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

826
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:37,137
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

827
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:38,705
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

828
00:56:38,707 --> 00:56:40,108
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

829
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,042
Okay, look.

830
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:45,112
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

831
00:56:45,114 --> 00:56:48,651
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

832
00:56:50,518 --> 00:56:51,685
Vision's stone.

833
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:53,020
Then we have to protect it.

834
00:56:53,022 --> 00:56:54,723
No, we have to destroy it.

835
00:56:56,859 --> 00:56:58,158
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

836
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,492
to this entity in my head.

837
00:56:59,494 --> 00:57:01,527
About its nature.

838
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:03,798
But also its composition.

839
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,866
I think if it were exposed

840
00:57:05,868 --> 00:57:07,868
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

841
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:11,739
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

842
00:57:13,408 --> 00:57:15,976
its molecular integrity
could fail.

843
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:18,744
Yeah, and you with it.

844
00:57:18,746 --> 00:57:20,446
We're not having
this conversation.

845
00:57:20,448 --> 00:57:22,515
Eliminating the stone
is the only way

846
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:24,952
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

847
00:57:24,954 --> 00:57:27,122
That's too high a price.

848
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:34,029
Only you have
the power to pay it.

849
00:57:38,433 --> 00:57:40,600
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

850
00:57:40,602 --> 00:57:43,170
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

851
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:44,706
But it should.

852
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:48,741
We don't trade lives, Vision.

853
00:57:48,743 --> 00:57:50,843
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

854
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:52,812
to save how many
millions of people?

855
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:54,981
Tell me,
why is this any different?

856
00:57:54,983 --> 00:57:57,418
Because you might
have a choice.

857
00:57:58,653 --> 00:57:59,986
Your mind is made up

858
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:02,622
of a complex construct
of overlays.

859
00:58:02,624 --> 00:58:06,225
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

860
00:58:06,227 --> 00:58:08,094
All of them mixed together,

861
00:58:08,096 --> 00:58:09,996
all of them
learning from one another.

862
00:58:09,998 --> 00:58:11,931
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

863
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:15,134
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

864
00:58:15,136 --> 00:58:16,736
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

865
00:58:16,738 --> 00:58:18,571
Perhaps the best parts.

866
00:58:18,573 --> 00:58:19,841
Can we do that?

867
00:58:20,608 --> 00:58:22,642
Not me, not here.

868
00:58:22,644 --> 00:58:24,143
Well,
you better find someone

869
00:58:24,145 --> 00:58:25,611
and somewhere fast.

870
00:58:25,613 --> 00:58:26,979
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

871
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:28,149
have your old rooms back.

872
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:32,854
I know somewhere.

873
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:48,834
The Kingsguard

874
00:58:48,836 --> 00:58:50,202
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

875
00:58:50,204 --> 00:58:52,204
And the Border Tribe?

876
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:54,106
Those that are left.

877
00:58:54,108 --> 00:58:56,541
Send word
to the Jabari as well.

878
00:58:56,543 --> 00:58:58,677
M'Baku likes a good fight.

879
00:59:00,848 --> 00:59:03,115
And what of this one?

880
00:59:03,117 --> 00:59:05,684
This one may be tired of war.

881
00:59:05,686 --> 00:59:08,722
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

882
00:59:31,245 --> 00:59:32,913
Where's the fight?

883
00:59:33,847 --> 00:59:35,183
On its way.

884
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,170
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

885
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:00,073
I have never failed him.

886
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:08,347
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

887
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:10,081
with the Time Stone
still attached

888
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:12,351
to your vaguely
irritating person...

889
01:00:12,353 --> 01:00:15,022
there would be judgment.

890
01:00:23,697 --> 01:00:25,132
Give me...

891
01:00:29,002 --> 01:00:30,003
the stone.

892
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:43,948
Wow, you're a seriously

893
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,150
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

894
01:00:45,152 --> 01:00:47,819
Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...

895
01:00:47,821 --> 01:00:49,187
What the...

896
01:00:49,189 --> 01:00:50,889
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

897
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:51,923
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

898
01:00:51,925 --> 01:00:53,358
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

899
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,259
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

900
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:55,326
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

901
01:00:55,328 --> 01:00:57,896
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

902
01:00:57,898 --> 01:00:59,030
God damn it.

903
01:00:59,032 --> 01:01:02,000
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

904
01:01:02,002 --> 01:01:03,401
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

905
01:01:03,403 --> 01:01:04,969
And now, I'm here in space.

906
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:07,638
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

907
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,841
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

908
01:01:09,843 --> 01:01:10,975
This is a one-way ticket.

909
01:01:10,977 --> 01:01:12,811
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

910
01:01:12,813 --> 01:01:13,912
No, I did think this through.

911
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:15,712
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

912
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,248
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

913
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,919
if there's no neighborhood.

914
01:01:21,054 --> 01:01:22,220
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

915
01:01:22,222 --> 01:01:23,689
but you know
what I'm trying to say.

916
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:29,693
Come on. We got a situation.

917
01:01:29,695 --> 01:01:30,762
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

918
01:01:30,764 --> 01:01:31,829
What's your plan?

919
01:01:31,831 --> 01:01:32,966
- Go.
- Um...

920
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:35,266
Okay, okay... Uh...

921
01:01:35,268 --> 01:01:38,702
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, <i>Aliens?</i>

922
01:01:42,209 --> 01:01:45,110
Painful, aren't they?

923
01:01:45,112 --> 01:01:48,812
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

924
01:01:48,814 --> 01:01:50,883
And any one of them...

925
01:01:55,955 --> 01:01:58,790
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

926
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,425
<i>I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.</i>

927
01:02:00,427 --> 01:02:03,163
<i>Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.</i>

928
01:02:04,997 --> 01:02:07,698
You've saved nothing.

929
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,767
Your powers
are inconsequential

930
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:11,269
compared to mine.

931
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:12,972
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

932
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,255
Yes! Wait.
What are those?

933
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,739
Hey,
we haven't officially met.

934
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,041
Cool.

935
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:52,509
We gotta turn
this ship around.

936
01:02:52,511 --> 01:02:54,878
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

937
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,313
No, I want to protect
the stone.

938
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,748
And I want you
to thank me.

939
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,283
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

940
01:02:59,285 --> 01:03:02,186
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

941
01:03:02,188 --> 01:03:04,521
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

942
01:03:04,523 --> 01:03:05,389
I seriously don't know

943
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:06,557
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

944
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,393
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

945
01:03:09,395 --> 01:03:11,128
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

946
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,197
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

947
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:14,932
And due to that fact,

948
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:16,333
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

949
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:18,202
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

950
01:03:18,204 --> 01:03:20,270
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

951
01:03:20,272 --> 01:03:21,338
The adults are talking.

952
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,208
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

953
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,043
What is he, your ward?

954
01:03:26,045 --> 01:03:27,444
No.

955
01:03:27,446 --> 01:03:29,479
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

956
01:03:29,481 --> 01:03:31,250
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

957
01:03:32,218 --> 01:03:34,351
I'm Spider-Man, then.

958
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:36,019
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

959
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,154
Thing's on autopilot.

960
01:03:37,156 --> 01:03:39,056
Can we control it?

961
01:03:39,058 --> 01:03:40,993
Fly us home?

962
01:03:43,996 --> 01:03:45,128
- Stark?
- Yeah.

963
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,463
Can you get us home?

964
01:03:46,465 --> 01:03:47,865
Yeah, I heard you.

965
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:51,470
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

966
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:53,869
Under no circumstances

967
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:56,440
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

968
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:57,840
I don't think
you quite understand

969
01:03:57,842 --> 01:03:58,775
what's at stake here.

970
01:03:58,777 --> 01:04:01,378
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

971
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,314
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

972
01:04:04,316 --> 01:04:06,048
Since he sent an army
to New York

973
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,817
and now he's back.

974
01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:09,885
And I don't know what to do.

975
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,020
So I'm not so sure

976
01:04:11,022 --> 01:04:13,055
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

977
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,892
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

978
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:19,195
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

979
01:04:19,197 --> 01:04:22,131
So I say we take
the fight to him.

980
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:23,134
Doctor.

981
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,438
Do you concur?

982
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:31,477
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

983
01:04:32,544 --> 01:04:34,910
But you have to understand...

984
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,513
if it comes to saving you

985
01:04:36,515 --> 01:04:39,215
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

986
01:04:39,217 --> 01:04:42,952
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

987
01:04:42,954 --> 01:04:47,156
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

988
01:04:47,158 --> 01:04:50,061
Nice. Good, moral compass.

989
01:04:51,296 --> 01:04:52,897
We're straight.

990
01:04:53,998 --> 01:04:55,400
All right, kid.

991
01:04:56,635 --> 01:04:57,869
You're an Avenger now.

992
01:05:34,339 --> 01:05:36,574
I thought
you might be hungry.

993
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:50,486
I always hated that chair.

994
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,255
So I've been told.

995
01:05:53,257 --> 01:05:57,195
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

996
01:05:57,994 --> 01:05:59,430
I hated this room.

997
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,697
This ship.

998
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:03,534
I hated my life.

999
01:06:08,071 --> 01:06:10,274
You told me that too.

1000
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:14,911
Every day.

1001
01:06:17,548 --> 01:06:19,517
For almost 20 years.

1002
01:06:22,152 --> 01:06:24,489
I was a child
when you took me.

1003
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,657
I saved you.

1004
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,260
No.

1005
01:06:32,663 --> 01:06:36,432
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1006
01:06:36,434 --> 01:06:38,166
Going to bed hungry...

1007
01:06:38,168 --> 01:06:40,068
scrounging for scraps.

1008
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:43,037
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1009
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,474
I'm the one who stopped that.

1010
01:06:45,476 --> 01:06:47,476
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1011
01:06:47,478 --> 01:06:49,678
The children born...

1012
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,314
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1013
01:06:53,316 --> 01:06:54,519
It's a paradise.

1014
01:06:57,254 --> 01:06:59,287
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1015
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:02,323
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1016
01:07:02,325 --> 01:07:03,458
You're insane.

1017
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,560
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1018
01:07:05,562 --> 01:07:09,030
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1019
01:07:09,032 --> 01:07:13,368
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1020
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,569
It needs correction.

1021
01:07:14,571 --> 01:07:16,072
You don't know that!

1022
01:07:17,507 --> 01:07:20,375
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1023
01:07:20,377 --> 01:07:24,548
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1024
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:27,217
For a time...

1025
01:07:29,686 --> 01:07:34,090
you had that same will...

1026
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:38,094
as you fought by my side.

1027
01:07:38,796 --> 01:07:40,030
Daughter.

1028
01:07:40,664 --> 01:07:42,499
I'm not your daughter.

1029
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:47,637
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1030
01:07:48,472 --> 01:07:50,071
And, in doing so,

1031
01:07:50,073 --> 01:07:52,275
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1032
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:58,081
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1033
01:08:01,384 --> 01:08:04,252
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1034
01:08:05,388 --> 01:08:08,055
I am disappointed.

1035
01:08:08,057 --> 01:08:10,427
But not because
you didn't find it.

1036
01:08:14,197 --> 01:08:15,699
But because you did.

1037
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:19,068
And you lied.

1038
01:08:36,151 --> 01:08:37,253
Nebula.

1039
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:45,860
Don't do this.

1040
01:08:45,862 --> 01:08:47,294
Some time ago,

1041
01:08:47,296 --> 01:08:50,197
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1042
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:51,265
Please don't do this.

1043
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:53,503
And very nearly succeeded.

1044
01:08:54,236 --> 01:08:55,605
So I brought her here.

1045
01:08:57,239 --> 01:08:58,440
To talk.

1046
01:09:06,148 --> 01:09:08,484
Stop. Stop it.

1047
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:17,257
I swear to you on my life.

1048
01:09:17,259 --> 01:09:19,495
I never found the Soul Stone.

1049
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:25,399
<i>Accessing memory files.</i>

1050
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:26,802
<i>You know
what he's about to do.</i>

1051
01:09:26,804 --> 01:09:29,603
<i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i>

1052
01:09:29,605 --> 01:09:30,806
<i>- All of them.
- He can never get them all.</i>

1053
01:09:30,808 --> 01:09:31,873
<i>He will!</i>

1054
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:34,174
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

1055
01:09:34,176 --> 01:09:36,577
<i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...</i>

1056
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:39,415
<i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i>

1057
01:09:44,453 --> 01:09:46,288
You're strong.

1058
01:09:48,324 --> 01:09:49,325
Me.

1059
01:09:51,795 --> 01:09:53,462
You're generous.

1060
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:55,731
Me.

1061
01:09:57,733 --> 01:10:00,400
But I never taught you to lie.

1062
01:10:00,402 --> 01:10:03,105
That's why
you're so bad at it.

1063
01:10:05,274 --> 01:10:09,712
Where is the Soul Stone?

1064
01:10:27,229 --> 01:10:28,230
Vormir!

1065
01:10:46,348 --> 01:10:47,816
The stone is on Vormir.

1066
01:10:51,252 --> 01:10:53,622
Show me.

1067
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:56,890
I am Groot.

1068
01:10:56,892 --> 01:10:58,257
Tinkle in the cup.

1069
01:10:58,259 --> 01:10:59,660
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

1070
01:10:59,662 --> 01:11:01,928
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

1071
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,329
I am Groot.

1072
01:11:03,331 --> 01:11:04,430
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1073
01:11:04,432 --> 01:11:06,265
out into space
and go in the cup again.

1074
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:07,366
You speak Groot?

1075
01:11:07,368 --> 01:11:09,536
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1076
01:11:09,538 --> 01:11:10,704
I am Groot.

1077
01:11:10,706 --> 01:11:12,839
You'll know when we're close.

1078
01:11:12,841 --> 01:11:14,574
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1079
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:16,745
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

1080
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:21,616
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

1081
01:11:22,383 --> 01:11:24,185
It's truly awesome.

1082
01:11:30,025 --> 01:11:33,327
Okay, time to be the captain.

1083
01:11:38,332 --> 01:11:40,499
So, dead brother, huh?

1084
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:42,769
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1085
01:11:42,771 --> 01:11:44,672
Well, he's been dead before.

1086
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:49,042
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

1087
01:11:49,044 --> 01:11:51,644
And you said
your sister and your dad?

1088
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:53,579
Both dead.

1089
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:55,715
But still got a mom, though?

1090
01:11:55,717 --> 01:11:57,050
Killed by a dark elf.

1091
01:11:57,052 --> 01:11:58,350
A best friend?

1092
01:11:58,352 --> 01:11:59,620
Stabbed through the heart.

1093
01:12:02,924 --> 01:12:06,260
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

1094
01:12:08,463 --> 01:12:09,962
Absolutely.

1095
01:12:09,964 --> 01:12:13,699
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

1096
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:15,434
they're all
tremendous motivators.

1097
01:12:15,436 --> 01:12:16,569
They really clear the mind.

1098
01:12:16,571 --> 01:12:18,805
So I'm good to go.

1099
01:12:18,807 --> 01:12:21,507
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

1100
01:12:21,509 --> 01:12:23,876
he's the toughest there is.

1101
01:12:23,878 --> 01:12:26,045
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

1102
01:12:26,047 --> 01:12:28,380
He's never fought me twice.

1103
01:12:28,382 --> 01:12:30,316
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1104
01:12:30,318 --> 01:12:32,520
It better be some hammer.

1105
01:12:36,624 --> 01:12:39,658
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1106
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,827
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

1107
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:43,863
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

1108
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:45,598
but none succeeded.

1109
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,667
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1110
01:12:48,669 --> 01:12:51,637
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1111
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:53,672
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1112
01:12:53,674 --> 01:12:55,574
Fate wills it so.

1113
01:12:55,576 --> 01:12:56,909
Mmm-hmm.

1114
01:12:56,911 --> 01:12:58,781
And what if you're wrong?

1115
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:03,851
If I'm wrong, then...

1116
01:13:05,086 --> 01:13:06,721
what more could I lose?

1117
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:21,934
I could lose a lot.

1118
01:13:21,936 --> 01:13:24,038
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

1119
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:28,876
Okay.

1120
01:13:31,946 --> 01:13:34,146
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

1121
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,048
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

1122
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,516
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

1123
01:13:38,518 --> 01:13:41,120
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

1124
01:13:41,122 --> 01:13:42,520
He gave you his eye?

1125
01:13:42,522 --> 01:13:43,756
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1126
01:13:43,758 --> 01:13:46,726
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1127
01:13:48,662 --> 01:13:49,929
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1128
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:50,932
Hmm.

1129
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:54,969
Huh?

1130
01:13:56,804 --> 01:13:58,103
Oh.

1131
01:13:58,105 --> 01:14:00,906
I would've washed that.

1132
01:14:00,908 --> 01:14:03,575
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

1133
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:05,846
Hey, we're here!

1134
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:11,083
I don't think
this thing works.

1135
01:14:11,085 --> 01:14:12,419
Everything seems dark.

1136
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:16,556
It ain't the eye.

1137
01:14:29,836 --> 01:14:31,138
Something's wrong.

1138
01:14:31,972 --> 01:14:33,607
The star's gone out.

1139
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:35,942
And the rings are frozen.

1140
01:14:57,063 --> 01:14:58,696
I hope
these dwarves are better

1141
01:14:58,698 --> 01:15:00,565
at forging
than they are cleaning.

1142
01:15:05,705 --> 01:15:07,238
Maybe they realized
that they live

1143
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,907
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

1144
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:11,878
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

1145
01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:16,948
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

1146
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:18,216
Yes, why?

1147
01:15:18,218 --> 01:15:20,452
It look
anything like that?

1148
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:25,723
I am Groot.

1149
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:27,127
Go back to the pod.

1150
01:15:31,131 --> 01:15:32,165
Eitri, wait!

1151
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:34,167
Stop!

1152
01:15:35,101 --> 01:15:36,102
Stop.

1153
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,871
Thor?

1154
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:42,974
What happened here?

1155
01:15:42,976 --> 01:15:46,144
You were supposed
to protect us.

1156
01:15:46,146 --> 01:15:48,980
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

1157
01:15:48,982 --> 01:15:51,151
Asgard is destroyed.

1158
01:15:53,552 --> 01:15:57,223
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

1159
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:13,039
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.

1160
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:17,476
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

1161
01:16:19,878 --> 01:16:21,247
I made what he wanted.

1162
01:16:23,015 --> 01:16:27,486
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1163
01:16:31,924 --> 01:16:34,593
Then he killed
everyone anyway.

1164
01:16:36,662 --> 01:16:38,497
All except me.

1165
01:16:39,565 --> 01:16:41,267
"Your life is yours," he said.

1166
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:47,637
"But your hands
are mine alone."

1167
01:16:47,639 --> 01:16:49,641
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.

1168
01:16:50,743 --> 01:16:52,276
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

1169
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:53,944
every axe, hammer, sword...

1170
01:16:53,946 --> 01:16:57,014
it's all inside your head.

1171
01:16:57,016 --> 01:16:59,082
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

1172
01:16:59,084 --> 01:17:01,084
Trust me, I know.

1173
01:17:01,086 --> 01:17:05,858
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

1174
01:17:46,265 --> 01:17:48,832
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1175
01:17:48,834 --> 01:17:51,003
I need you
to meet me on Titan.

1176
01:17:57,642 --> 01:17:58,875
Hey, what's going on?

1177
01:17:58,877 --> 01:18:00,177
I think we're here.

1178
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:02,747
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1179
01:18:04,349 --> 01:18:06,049
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

1180
01:18:06,051 --> 01:18:07,086
Close those around it.

1181
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:09,986
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

1182
01:18:09,988 --> 01:18:11,288
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta

1183
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:13,051
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.

1184
01:18:17,362 --> 01:18:18,861
We might wanna turn.

1185
01:18:18,863 --> 01:18:20,065
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1186
01:18:50,027 --> 01:18:51,629
You all right?

1187
01:18:52,464 --> 01:18:54,233
That was close.

1188
01:18:55,733 --> 01:18:57,334
I owe you one.

1189
01:18:57,336 --> 01:18:59,469
Let me just say, if aliens

1190
01:18:59,471 --> 01:19:01,404
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

1191
01:19:01,406 --> 01:19:02,439
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.

1192
01:19:02,441 --> 01:19:05,174
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

1193
01:19:05,176 --> 01:19:06,909
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

1194
01:19:06,911 --> 01:19:08,591
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

1195
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,888
Thanos!

1196
01:19:37,742 --> 01:19:39,809
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

1197
01:19:41,145 --> 01:19:43,714
Stay down, clown.

1198
01:19:48,886 --> 01:19:50,955
Die, blanket of death!

1199
01:19:56,894 --> 01:19:59,830
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.

1200
01:20:00,998 --> 01:20:03,000
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.

1201
01:20:03,802 --> 01:20:05,134
Where is Gamora?

1202
01:20:05,136 --> 01:20:07,970
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

1203
01:20:07,972 --> 01:20:10,940
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

1204
01:20:10,942 --> 01:20:12,942
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you

1205
01:20:12,944 --> 01:20:14,210
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

1206
01:20:14,212 --> 01:20:17,812
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1207
01:20:17,814 --> 01:20:20,416
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1208
01:20:20,418 --> 01:20:22,551
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

1209
01:20:22,553 --> 01:20:24,919
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

1210
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:26,021
I'll kill all three of you

1211
01:20:26,023 --> 01:20:28,023
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.

1212
01:20:28,025 --> 01:20:29,091
Starting with you.

1213
01:20:29,093 --> 01:20:30,025
Wait, what, Thanos?

1214
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:32,894
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

1215
01:20:32,896 --> 01:20:34,563
What master do you serve?

1216
01:20:34,565 --> 01:20:36,030
What master do I serve?

1217
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:37,401
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

1218
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:39,268
You're from Earth.

1219
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,169
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

1220
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:42,137
Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.

1221
01:20:42,139 --> 01:20:43,305
What are you hassling us for?

1222
01:20:43,307 --> 01:20:45,108
So you're not
with Thanos?

1223
01:20:45,509 --> 01:20:48,009
With Thanos?

1224
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:50,812
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1225
01:20:50,814 --> 01:20:53,349
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1226
01:20:53,351 --> 01:20:55,183
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.

1227
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:57,553
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

1228
01:20:57,555 --> 01:20:59,020
You know Thor?

1229
01:20:59,022 --> 01:20:59,988
Yeah.

1230
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:02,857
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

1231
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,395
Where is he now?

1232
01:21:19,443 --> 01:21:21,477
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1233
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:22,846
It's a mold.

1234
01:21:23,447 --> 01:21:25,413
A king's weapon.

1235
01:21:25,415 --> 01:21:28,383
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1236
01:21:28,385 --> 01:21:31,419
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1237
01:21:31,421 --> 01:21:32,989
Did it have a name?

1238
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,890
Stormbreaker.

1239
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:36,993
That's a bit much.

1240
01:21:39,029 --> 01:21:40,096
So how do we make it?

1241
01:21:41,965 --> 01:21:44,134
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1242
01:21:45,101 --> 01:21:47,270
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1243
01:21:49,973 --> 01:21:52,475
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1244
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:58,313
The hell happened
to this planet?

1245
01:21:58,315 --> 01:22:00,214
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

1246
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:02,385
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1247
01:22:03,653 --> 01:22:07,455
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1248
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:10,291
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1249
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:11,626
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1250
01:22:11,628 --> 01:22:13,161
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1251
01:22:13,163 --> 01:22:14,462
pin him down,
get what we need.

1252
01:22:14,464 --> 01:22:16,264
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1253
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:17,965
We just want the gauntlet.

1254
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:20,335
Are you yawning?

1255
01:22:20,337 --> 01:22:22,603
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1256
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:24,439
Did you hear what I said?

1257
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:26,974
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

1258
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:28,042
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1259
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:31,179
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1260
01:22:31,181 --> 01:22:32,913
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

1261
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:34,515
Kick names, take ass.

1262
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:35,918
Yeah, that's right.

1263
01:22:42,492 --> 01:22:44,292
All right, just get over here,
please.

1264
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:46,361
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1265
01:22:46,363 --> 01:22:48,498
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1266
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:52,633
We gotta coalesce.

1267
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,469
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1268
01:22:54,471 --> 01:22:57,037
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1269
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,506
We don't know what it means.

1270
01:22:58,508 --> 01:23:01,309
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1271
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:04,010
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1272
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,079
and that way
it might be really good.

1273
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:08,181
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1274
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,418
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

1275
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,586
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

1276
01:23:11,588 --> 01:23:13,521
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

1277
01:23:13,523 --> 01:23:15,255
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1278
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:16,491
It never was.

1279
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:17,592
Don't encourage this,
all right?

1280
01:23:17,594 --> 01:23:19,092
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

1281
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:20,628
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

1282
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:22,397
By the way,
that's a compliment.

1283
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:24,131
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1284
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:25,568
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1285
01:23:26,736 --> 01:23:28,068
that's 100% you.

1286
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,336
Your math
is blowing my mind.

1287
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:30,573
Excuse me.

1288
01:23:31,574 --> 01:23:35,110
But does your friend
often do that?

1289
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:38,681
Strange, we all right?

1290
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:50,223
You're back. You're all right.

1291
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,459
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

1292
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:57,097
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1293
01:23:57,099 --> 01:23:58,598
To see all
the possible outcomes

1294
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,469
of the coming conflict.

1295
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,669
How many did you see?

1296
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:05,073
14,000,605.

1297
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,143
How many did we win?

1298
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:14,082
One.

1299
01:24:35,805 --> 01:24:39,007
The stone
had better be up there.

1300
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:42,744
For your sister's sake.

1301
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:08,470
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1302
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:14,073
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1303
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:15,342
You know us?

1304
01:25:15,344 --> 01:25:20,380
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1305
01:25:20,382 --> 01:25:22,116
Where is the Soul Stone?

1306
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:25,150
You should know...

1307
01:25:25,152 --> 01:25:28,256
it extracts a terrible price.

1308
01:25:29,525 --> 01:25:31,192
I am prepared.

1309
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:36,097
We all think that at first.

1310
01:25:40,536 --> 01:25:42,772
We are all wrong.

1311
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:56,850
How is it you know
this place so well?

1312
01:25:56,852 --> 01:26:01,688
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1313
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,590
I even held one in my hand.

1314
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:08,763
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1315
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:12,802
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1316
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:24,512
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1317
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:27,582
As does what you fear.

1318
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:30,349
What's this?

1319
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:31,918
The price.

1320
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,623
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1321
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:41,696
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1322
01:26:43,197 --> 01:26:45,197
Tell me what it needs.

1323
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:48,768
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1324
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,405
understands its power...

1325
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:56,308
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1326
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:58,277
Of what?

1327
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,312
In order to take the stone,

1328
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:02,650
you must lose
that which you love.

1329
01:27:05,586 --> 01:27:06,821
A soul...

1330
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,756
for a soul.

1331
01:27:24,538 --> 01:27:26,808
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...

1332
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:29,275
a moment...

1333
01:27:30,544 --> 01:27:32,613
when you got
what you deserved.

1334
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:37,217
And I was always
so disappointed.

1335
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,255
But now...

1336
01:27:46,226 --> 01:27:49,295
You kill and torture...

1337
01:27:51,264 --> 01:27:53,266
and you call it mercy.

1338
01:27:57,337 --> 01:27:59,406
The universe has judged you.

1339
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:05,445
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1340
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:08,481
You failed.

1341
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,686
And do you wanna know why?

1342
01:28:12,652 --> 01:28:14,521
Because you love nothing.

1343
01:28:15,288 --> 01:28:16,792
No one.

1344
01:28:22,495 --> 01:28:23,630
No.

1345
01:28:28,334 --> 01:28:29,335
Really?

1346
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:31,438
Tears?

1347
01:28:32,272 --> 01:28:34,240
They're not for him.

1348
01:28:48,455 --> 01:28:49,622
No.

1349
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:52,559
This isn't love.

1350
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,995
I ignored my destiny once.

1351
01:28:58,565 --> 01:29:00,700
I cannot do that again.

1352
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:04,604
Even for you.

1353
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:31,064
I'm sorry, little one.

1354
01:29:34,934 --> 01:29:36,335
No!

1355
01:31:13,832 --> 01:31:16,833
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1356
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:18,168
I hope you're right
about this.

1357
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:21,073
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

1358
01:31:36,855 --> 01:31:38,221
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda

1359
01:31:38,223 --> 01:31:39,623
to the rest of the world...

1360
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:41,925
this is not what I imagined.

1361
01:31:41,927 --> 01:31:44,027
And what did you imagine?

1362
01:31:44,029 --> 01:31:45,462
The Olympics.

1363
01:31:45,464 --> 01:31:47,065
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1364
01:32:01,246 --> 01:32:02,879
Should we bow?

1365
01:32:02,881 --> 01:32:04,547
Yeah, he's a king.

1366
01:32:04,549 --> 01:32:06,550
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1367
01:32:07,686 --> 01:32:09,853
What are you doing?

1368
01:32:09,855 --> 01:32:11,988
Uh, we don't do that here.

1369
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:14,523
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1370
01:32:14,525 --> 01:32:17,661
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

1371
01:32:17,663 --> 01:32:18,728
How we looking?

1372
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:20,765
You will have my Kingsguard,

1373
01:32:20,767 --> 01:32:24,700
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...

1374
01:32:24,702 --> 01:32:27,638
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.

1375
01:32:30,541 --> 01:32:31,809
How you been, Buck?

1376
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:34,913
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.

1377
01:32:46,959 --> 01:32:48,058
Whoa.

1378
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,693
The structure is polymorphic.

1379
01:32:50,695 --> 01:32:53,929
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1380
01:32:53,931 --> 01:32:55,864
Why didn't you just reprogram

1381
01:32:55,866 --> 01:32:57,970
the synapses
to work collectively?

1382
01:32:59,037 --> 01:33:02,772
Because we didn't think of it.

1383
01:33:02,774 --> 01:33:04,140
I'm sure you did your best.

1384
01:33:04,142 --> 01:33:06,242
Can you do it?

1385
01:33:06,244 --> 01:33:09,812
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.

1386
01:33:09,814 --> 01:33:13,249
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1387
01:33:13,251 --> 01:33:14,518
It will take time, brother.

1388
01:33:16,087 --> 01:33:17,187
How long?

1389
01:33:17,189 --> 01:33:18,620
As long as you can give me.

1390
01:33:23,094 --> 01:33:25,263
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1391
01:33:42,146 --> 01:33:44,582
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.

1392
01:33:53,991 --> 01:33:55,591
God, I love this place.

1393
01:33:55,593 --> 01:33:57,760
<i>Yeah, don't
start celebrating yet, guys.</i>

1394
01:33:57,763 --> 01:33:59,697
<i>We got more incoming
outside the dome.</i>

1395
01:34:18,883 --> 01:34:19,950
It's too late.

1396
01:34:20,985 --> 01:34:22,851
We need to destroy
the stone now.

1397
01:34:22,853 --> 01:34:24,686
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.

1398
01:34:24,688 --> 01:34:26,088
We will hold them off.

1399
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:29,758
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

1400
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,762
you blow it to hell.

1401
01:34:31,095 --> 01:34:32,294
I will.

1402
01:34:32,296 --> 01:34:35,132
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.

1403
01:34:35,933 --> 01:34:37,301
And get this man a shield.

1404
01:34:47,844 --> 01:34:48,977
<i>I don't think</i>

1405
01:34:48,979 --> 01:34:50,345
<i>you get the scientifics here.</i>

1406
01:34:50,347 --> 01:34:52,915
<i>These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...</i>

1407
01:34:52,917 --> 01:34:54,283
<i>you're gonna need something
a lot bigger</i>

1408
01:34:54,285 --> 01:34:55,650
<i>to yank 'em loose.</i>

1409
01:34:55,652 --> 01:34:57,819
- Leave that to me.
- <i>Leave it to you?</i>

1410
01:34:57,821 --> 01:35:00,989
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1411
01:35:09,266 --> 01:35:10,332
<i>Fire the engines!</i>

1412
01:35:27,917 --> 01:35:30,653
More power, rabbit!

1413
01:36:02,018 --> 01:36:03,853
Well done, boy.

1414
01:36:05,489 --> 01:36:07,423
That's Nidavellir.

1415
01:36:27,477 --> 01:36:29,010
Damn it.

1416
01:36:29,012 --> 01:36:30,779
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1417
01:36:30,781 --> 01:36:32,180
<i>The mechanism
is crippled.</i>

1418
01:36:32,182 --> 01:36:33,782
- What?
- With the iris closed,

1419
01:36:33,784 --> 01:36:34,949
I can't heat the metal.

1420
01:36:34,951 --> 01:36:36,751
How long will it take
to heat it?

1421
01:36:36,753 --> 01:36:39,055
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?

1422
01:36:41,057 --> 01:36:42,223
I'm gonna hold it open.

1423
01:36:42,225 --> 01:36:43,457
That's suicide.

1424
01:36:43,459 --> 01:36:45,995
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1425
01:36:55,837 --> 01:36:56,804
How we looking, Bruce?

1426
01:36:56,806 --> 01:36:58,740
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

1427
01:37:01,978 --> 01:37:04,111
Wow! This is amazing, man.

1428
01:37:04,113 --> 01:37:06,113
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...

1429
01:37:09,918 --> 01:37:12,088
<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>

1430
01:37:13,489 --> 01:37:14,555
I've got two heat signatures

1431
01:37:14,557 --> 01:37:15,757
breaking through
the tree line.

1432
01:37:44,119 --> 01:37:46,820
Thank you
for standing with us.

1433
01:37:46,822 --> 01:37:47,923
Of course, brother.

1434
01:38:08,277 --> 01:38:10,578
Where's your other friend?

1435
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:13,081
You will pay for his life
with yours.

1436
01:38:14,082 --> 01:38:17,050
Thanos will have that stone.

1437
01:38:17,052 --> 01:38:18,552
That's not gonna happen.

1438
01:38:18,554 --> 01:38:21,121
You are in Wakanda now.

1439
01:38:21,123 --> 01:38:24,493
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

1440
01:38:27,896 --> 01:38:29,863
We have blood to spare.

1441
01:38:41,143 --> 01:38:42,577
They surrender?

1442
01:38:43,412 --> 01:38:44,477
Not exactly.

1443
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,974
What the hell?

1444
01:39:15,943 --> 01:39:17,510
Looks like we pissed her off.

1445
01:39:28,256 --> 01:39:29,890
They're killing themselves.

1446
01:40:06,093 --> 01:40:07,627
You see the teeth
on those things?

1447
01:40:07,629 --> 01:40:08,695
All right, back up, Sam.

1448
01:40:08,697 --> 01:40:10,058
You're gonna get
your wings singed.

1449
01:40:22,309 --> 01:40:23,710
<i>Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter</i>

1450
01:40:23,712 --> 01:40:24,844
<i>and get in behind us...</i>

1451
01:40:24,846 --> 01:40:27,212
<i>there's nothing
between them and Vision.</i>

1452
01:40:27,214 --> 01:40:29,181
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.

1453
01:40:29,183 --> 01:40:30,451
How do we do that?

1454
01:40:32,754 --> 01:40:34,455
We open the barrier.

1455
01:40:36,658 --> 01:40:41,226
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.

1456
01:40:41,228 --> 01:40:43,195
<i>Requesting
confirmation, My King.</i>

1457
01:40:43,197 --> 01:40:45,063
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

1458
01:40:45,065 --> 01:40:46,432
On my signal.

1459
01:40:46,434 --> 01:40:48,335
This will be
the end of Wakanda.

1460
01:40:49,603 --> 01:40:53,140
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

1461
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:07,553
Wakanda forever!

1462
01:41:20,034 --> 01:41:21,035
Now!

1463
01:41:51,298 --> 01:41:52,765
How much longer, Shuri?

1464
01:41:52,767 --> 01:41:54,533
I've barely begun, brother.

1465
01:41:54,535 --> 01:41:56,403
You might want to pick up
the pace.

1466
01:42:03,444 --> 01:42:05,477
Allfathers, give me strength.

1467
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:07,446
You understand, boy?

1468
01:42:07,448 --> 01:42:10,451
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

1469
01:42:11,418 --> 01:42:13,485
It'll kill you.

1470
01:42:13,487 --> 01:42:15,656
Only if I die.

1471
01:42:16,089 --> 01:42:17,489
Yes.

1472
01:42:17,491 --> 01:42:20,293
That's what killing you means.

1473
01:42:48,288 --> 01:42:50,223
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1474
01:43:40,607 --> 01:43:42,575
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1475
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:44,510
Thor, you okay?

1476
01:43:50,249 --> 01:43:51,616
I think he's dying.

1477
01:43:51,618 --> 01:43:53,586
He needs the axe!

1478
01:43:54,954 --> 01:43:56,422
Where's the handle?

1479
01:43:59,459 --> 01:44:01,728
Tree, help me find the handle!

1480
01:45:10,629 --> 01:45:12,799
There's too many of 'em!

1481
01:45:39,391 --> 01:45:42,726
You guys
are so screwed now!

1482
01:45:45,964 --> 01:45:48,031
Bring me Thanos!

1483
01:46:20,767 --> 01:46:22,366
Oh, yeah.

1484
01:46:25,470 --> 01:46:27,472
You're much more of a Thanos.

1485
01:46:29,741 --> 01:46:31,877
I take it the Maw is dead.

1486
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:36,681
This day
extracts a heavy toll.

1487
01:46:38,449 --> 01:46:40,950
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1488
01:46:40,952 --> 01:46:42,554
You may regret that.

1489
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,789
He brought you face-to-face

1490
01:46:44,791 --> 01:46:46,323
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.

1491
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:51,830
And where do you think
he brought you?

1492
01:46:52,898 --> 01:46:55,667
Let me guess. Your home?

1493
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:01,405
It was.

1494
01:47:04,009 --> 01:47:05,543
And it was beautiful.

1495
01:47:08,046 --> 01:47:10,746
Titan was like most planets.

1496
01:47:10,748 --> 01:47:13,783
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1497
01:47:13,785 --> 01:47:16,988
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1498
01:47:17,989 --> 01:47:19,923
Genocide.

1499
01:47:19,925 --> 01:47:23,995
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1500
01:47:25,462 --> 01:47:28,164
They called me a madman.

1501
01:47:28,166 --> 01:47:30,568
And what I predicted
came to pass.

1502
01:47:33,138 --> 01:47:35,339
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.

1503
01:47:35,807 --> 01:47:37,106
I'm a survivor.

1504
01:47:37,108 --> 01:47:39,608
Who wants to murder trillions.

1505
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:43,812
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1506
01:47:43,814 --> 01:47:48,586
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1507
01:47:50,654 --> 01:47:52,056
And then what?

1508
01:47:53,524 --> 01:47:55,757
I'd finally rest...

1509
01:47:55,759 --> 01:47:59,995
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1510
01:47:59,997 --> 01:48:04,499
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1511
01:48:04,501 --> 01:48:09,073
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.

1512
01:48:10,608 --> 01:48:11,609
Our?

1513
01:48:17,681 --> 01:48:19,147
Piece of cake, Quill.

1514
01:48:19,149 --> 01:48:21,552
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.

1515
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:01,056
Boom!

1516
01:49:01,058 --> 01:49:03,827
Don't let him close his fist.

1517
01:49:07,998 --> 01:49:08,999
Magic.

1518
01:49:09,699 --> 01:49:10,700
More magic.

1519
01:49:11,567 --> 01:49:12,568
Magic with a kick.

1520
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:14,071
Magic with a...

1521
01:49:15,538 --> 01:49:16,774
Insect!

1522
01:49:54,111 --> 01:49:55,543
Well, well.

1523
01:49:55,545 --> 01:49:56,711
You should've killed me.

1524
01:49:56,713 --> 01:49:58,546
It would've been
a waste of parts!

1525
01:50:03,987 --> 01:50:05,152
Where's Gamora?

1526
01:50:46,362 --> 01:50:47,728
<i>Is he under?
Don't let up.</i>

1527
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:50,364
Be quick. He is very strong.

1528
01:50:50,366 --> 01:50:52,733
Parker, help! Get over here.

1529
01:50:52,735 --> 01:50:55,004
<i>She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.</i>

1530
01:51:00,376 --> 01:51:01,709
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.

1531
01:51:01,711 --> 01:51:02,877
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.

1532
01:51:02,879 --> 01:51:04,159
For the record,
this was my plan.

1533
01:51:05,314 --> 01:51:07,083
You're not so strong now, huh?

1534
01:51:07,683 --> 01:51:09,350
Where is Gamora?

1535
01:51:09,352 --> 01:51:11,651
My Gamora.

1536
01:51:11,653 --> 01:51:13,921
No, bullshit!

1537
01:51:13,923 --> 01:51:15,158
Where is she?

1538
01:51:16,225 --> 01:51:17,659
He is in anguish.

1539
01:51:18,227 --> 01:51:20,294
Good.

1540
01:51:20,296 --> 01:51:23,197
He... He mourns.

1541
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:26,903
What does
this monster have to mourn?

1542
01:51:27,669 --> 01:51:28,737
Gamora.

1543
01:51:32,641 --> 01:51:33,974
What?

1544
01:51:33,976 --> 01:51:36,077
He took her to Vormir.

1545
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:38,047
He came back
with the Soul Stone.

1546
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,283
But she didn't.

1547
01:51:42,218 --> 01:51:46,253
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

1548
01:51:46,255 --> 01:51:49,825
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1549
01:51:51,027 --> 01:51:52,028
Tell me she's lying.

1550
01:51:54,397 --> 01:51:57,233
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!

1551
01:51:58,801 --> 01:52:02,138
I had to.

1552
01:52:02,938 --> 01:52:04,338
No, you didn't.

1553
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:06,175
No, you didn't.

1554
01:52:10,045 --> 01:52:11,445
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1555
01:52:11,447 --> 01:52:14,047
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!

1556
01:52:14,049 --> 01:52:15,282
<i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

1557
01:52:15,284 --> 01:52:17,525
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!

1558
01:52:20,722 --> 01:52:21,723
Oh, God.

1559
01:53:20,115 --> 01:53:23,816
Come and get some,
space dogs!

1560
01:53:26,454 --> 01:53:29,255
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1561
01:53:29,257 --> 01:53:31,391
Come on! Get some!

1562
01:53:31,393 --> 01:53:34,127
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1563
01:53:34,129 --> 01:53:36,031
Okay. How much for the arm?

1564
01:53:37,933 --> 01:53:39,999
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1565
01:53:48,842 --> 01:53:50,143
New haircut?

1566
01:53:50,145 --> 01:53:51,379
Noticed you've copied
my beard.

1567
01:53:53,881 --> 01:53:55,883
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.

1568
01:53:56,817 --> 01:53:58,752
I am Groot.

1569
01:53:59,554 --> 01:54:01,454
I am Steve Rogers.

1570
01:54:21,175 --> 01:54:23,311
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1571
01:54:32,853 --> 01:54:35,087
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.

1572
01:54:35,089 --> 01:54:36,190
I'm doing it.

1573
01:55:00,114 --> 01:55:01,815
Why was she up there
all this time?

1574
01:55:02,584 --> 01:55:05,486
She's on the field. Take it.

1575
01:55:37,184 --> 01:55:39,351
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.

1576
01:55:42,089 --> 01:55:44,189
Somebody get to Vision!

1577
01:55:44,191 --> 01:55:46,026
<i>- I got him!</i>
- On my way.

1578
01:55:51,332 --> 01:55:54,333
He'll die alone. As will you.

1579
01:55:54,335 --> 01:55:55,569
She's not alone.

1580
01:56:21,961 --> 01:56:23,662
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

1581
01:56:23,664 --> 01:56:25,364
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.

1582
01:56:25,366 --> 01:56:27,932
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.

1583
01:56:27,934 --> 01:56:28,999
<i>What? No! No!</i>

1584
01:56:32,539 --> 01:56:35,309
<i>Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!</i>

1585
01:56:37,311 --> 01:56:39,043
Hulk? Hulk,

1586
01:56:39,045 --> 01:56:41,112
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

1587
01:56:41,114 --> 01:56:43,617
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

1588
01:56:48,187 --> 01:56:49,623
Hulk! Hulk!

1589
01:56:50,524 --> 01:56:51,525
Hulk!

1590
01:56:52,659 --> 01:56:55,126
No!

1591
01:56:55,128 --> 01:56:58,062
Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!

1592
01:56:58,064 --> 01:56:59,232
I'll do it myself!

1593
01:57:00,166 --> 01:57:02,034
<i>Come on! Yeah!</i>

1594
01:57:14,313 --> 01:57:16,046
<i>See ya!</i>

1595
01:57:27,427 --> 01:57:30,094
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1596
01:57:41,073 --> 01:57:42,975
I thought you were formidable,
machine.

1597
01:57:43,743 --> 01:57:46,379
But you're dying,
like any man.

1598
01:57:55,054 --> 01:57:56,255
Get outta here!

1599
01:57:59,592 --> 01:58:00,626
Go!

1600
01:58:19,412 --> 01:58:21,147
That was really gross.

1601
01:58:48,273 --> 01:58:49,353
I thought I told you to go.

1602
01:58:50,811 --> 01:58:52,779
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1603
01:59:04,189 --> 01:59:06,422
I got you. I got you.

1604
01:59:06,424 --> 01:59:08,426
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

1605
01:59:53,638 --> 01:59:55,305
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1606
01:59:57,309 --> 02:00:00,245
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1607
02:00:03,582 --> 02:00:04,647
A fake.

1608
02:00:12,557 --> 02:00:16,259
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

1609
02:00:16,261 --> 02:00:17,527
Stark.

1610
02:00:17,529 --> 02:00:18,597
You know me?

1611
02:00:19,297 --> 02:00:20,830
I do.

1612
02:00:20,832 --> 02:00:24,135
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1613
02:00:24,869 --> 02:00:26,338
My only curse is you.

1614
02:00:28,808 --> 02:00:29,809
Come on!

1615
02:00:57,770 --> 02:00:59,738
All that for a drop of blood.

1616
02:01:43,783 --> 02:01:45,616
You have my respect, Stark.

1617
02:01:47,351 --> 02:01:50,521
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1618
02:01:55,927 --> 02:01:58,195
I hope they remember you.

1619
02:02:07,838 --> 02:02:08,939
Stop.

1620
02:02:15,379 --> 02:02:16,380
Spare his life...

1621
02:02:18,015 --> 02:02:19,817
and I will give you the stone.

1622
02:02:23,454 --> 02:02:24,688
No tricks.

1623
02:02:29,526 --> 02:02:30,527
Don't.

1624
02:03:21,879 --> 02:03:23,647
One to go.

1625
02:03:33,556 --> 02:03:34,892
Where is he?

1626
02:03:43,867 --> 02:03:45,368
Did we just lose?

1627
02:03:49,106 --> 02:03:51,041
Why would you do that?

1628
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:56,712
We're in the endgame now.

1629
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:24,105
Are you okay?

1630
02:04:26,008 --> 02:04:27,842
What? What is it?

1631
02:04:29,912 --> 02:04:31,013
He's here.

1632
02:04:42,024 --> 02:04:45,061
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.

1633
02:04:47,864 --> 02:04:49,832
What the hell?

1634
02:05:15,458 --> 02:05:16,459
Cap.

1635
02:05:17,059 --> 02:05:18,628
That's him.

1636
02:05:20,663 --> 02:05:23,132
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1637
02:05:47,723 --> 02:05:48,724
Wanda.

1638
02:05:49,825 --> 02:05:51,191
It's time.

1639
02:05:51,193 --> 02:05:52,525
No.

1640
02:05:52,527 --> 02:05:54,828
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.

1641
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:56,496
Look at me.

1642
02:05:56,498 --> 02:05:57,697
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

1643
02:05:57,699 --> 02:05:58,766
Don't.

1644
02:05:58,768 --> 02:05:59,968
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1645
02:06:01,871 --> 02:06:04,539
We are out of time.

1646
02:06:05,174 --> 02:06:06,606
I can't.

1647
02:06:06,608 --> 02:06:07,944
Yes, you can.

1648
02:06:08,677 --> 02:06:09,879
You can.

1649
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,715
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1650
02:06:16,018 --> 02:06:17,619
It's not fair.

1651
02:06:18,788 --> 02:06:20,455
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

1652
02:06:22,224 --> 02:06:23,793
It's all right.

1653
02:06:25,127 --> 02:06:26,895
You could never hurt me.

1654
02:06:35,937 --> 02:06:37,773
I just feel you.

1655
02:08:00,889 --> 02:08:01,990
It's all right.

1656
02:08:11,933 --> 02:08:13,201
It's all right.

1657
02:08:17,671 --> 02:08:18,739
I love you.

1658
02:08:48,001 --> 02:08:50,104
I understand, my child.

1659
02:08:51,738 --> 02:08:53,241
Better than anyone.

1660
02:08:54,975 --> 02:08:56,910
You could never.

1661
02:09:01,783 --> 02:09:04,786
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1662
02:09:06,421 --> 02:09:09,123
But now is no time to mourn.

1663
02:09:11,326 --> 02:09:15,329
Now is no time at all.

1664
02:09:38,786 --> 02:09:39,787
No!

1665
02:10:37,778 --> 02:10:39,146
I told you...

1666
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,316
you'd die for that.

1667
02:10:56,797 --> 02:10:58,398
You should have...

1668
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:02,469
You should...

1669
02:11:05,071 --> 02:11:08,275
You should have
gone for the head.

1670
02:11:10,209 --> 02:11:11,210
No!

1671
02:11:44,543 --> 02:11:45,911
Daughter?

1672
02:11:53,419 --> 02:11:54,920
Did you do it?

1673
02:11:56,856 --> 02:11:57,857
Yes.

1674
02:12:06,198 --> 02:12:07,867
What did it cost?

1675
02:12:11,437 --> 02:12:13,039
Everything.

1676
02:12:23,249 --> 02:12:24,884
What did you do?

1677
02:12:26,085 --> 02:12:27,486
What'd you do?

1678
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:42,501
Where'd he go?

1679
02:12:45,438 --> 02:12:46,603
Thor.

1680
02:12:49,941 --> 02:12:51,575
Where'd he go?

1681
02:12:51,577 --> 02:12:52,977
Steve?

1682
02:13:27,646 --> 02:13:30,547
Up, General. Up!

1683
02:13:30,549 --> 02:13:32,148
This is no place to die.

1684
02:13:47,132 --> 02:13:48,665
I am Groot.

1685
02:13:48,667 --> 02:13:50,301
Oh...

1686
02:13:51,202 --> 02:13:53,271
No, no, no!

1687
02:13:54,139 --> 02:13:57,008
Groot! No.

1688
02:14:10,355 --> 02:14:11,489
Sam!

1689
02:14:15,527 --> 02:14:17,228
Sam, where you at?

1690
02:14:26,504 --> 02:14:28,673
Something's happening.

1691
02:14:40,786 --> 02:14:42,120
Quill?

1692
02:14:49,427 --> 02:14:50,693
Steady, Quill.

1693
02:14:50,695 --> 02:14:51,995
Oh, man.

1694
02:14:56,134 --> 02:14:57,135
Tony.

1695
02:15:00,572 --> 02:15:03,141
There was no other way.

1696
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:09,681
Mr. Stark?

1697
02:15:14,252 --> 02:15:15,520
I don't feel so good.

1698
02:15:17,589 --> 02:15:18,488
You're all right.

1699
02:15:18,490 --> 02:15:19,790
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.

1700
02:15:19,792 --> 02:15:21,426
I don't know...

1701
02:15:23,227 --> 02:15:24,360
I don't want to go.

1702
02:15:24,362 --> 02:15:26,261
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.

1703
02:15:26,263 --> 02:15:29,032
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

1704
02:15:33,471 --> 02:15:35,072
I'm sorry.

1705
02:15:49,754 --> 02:15:51,321
He did it.

1706
02:16:16,146 --> 02:16:19,316
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

1707
02:16:36,233 --> 02:16:37,834
Oh, God.

1708
02:27:34,186 --> 02:27:35,786
<i>Still no word
from Stark?</i>

1709
02:27:35,788 --> 02:27:37,119
<i>No, not yet.</i>

1710
02:27:37,121 --> 02:27:38,222
<i>We're watching every satellite</i>

1711
02:27:38,224 --> 02:27:40,390
<i>on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.</i>

1712
02:27:40,392 --> 02:27:42,492
What is it?

1713
02:27:42,494 --> 02:27:45,094
Multiple bogeys
over Wakanda.

1714
02:27:45,096 --> 02:27:47,163
Same energy signature
as New York?

1715
02:27:47,165 --> 02:27:48,434
Ten times bigger.

1716
02:27:50,034 --> 02:27:51,200
Tell Klein
we'll meet him at...

1717
02:27:51,202 --> 02:27:52,302
Nick! Nick!

1718
02:28:05,950 --> 02:28:07,185
They okay?

1719
02:28:08,186 --> 02:28:10,052
There's no one here.

1720
02:28:19,430 --> 02:28:21,032
Call Control.

1721
02:28:21,833 --> 02:28:23,067
Code red.

1722
02:28:23,602 --> 02:28:24,803
Nick.

1723
02:28:26,337 --> 02:28:27,338
Hill.

1724
02:28:42,287 --> 02:28:43,421
Oh, no.

1725
02:28:45,123 --> 02:28:46,124
Mother...
