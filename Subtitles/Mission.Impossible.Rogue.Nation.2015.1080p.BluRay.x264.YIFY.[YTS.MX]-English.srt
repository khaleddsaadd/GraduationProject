00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,290
You mean shoot to kill.

530
00:44:47,325 --> 00:44:51,432
Whether Hunt lives or
dies is entirely up to him.

531
00:45:51,484 --> 00:45:52,756
New identity.

532
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,910
Passport, cash, move map.

533
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:56,490
There's a change of clothes
in that bag right there.

534
00:45:56,525 --> 00:45:59,410
Everything you need to
make it to D.C. undetected.

535
00:45:59,445 --> 00:46:01,973
Once you're there, you
have to inform on me.

536
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:03,004
I'm sorry, what?

537
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:04,073
Just tell the truth.

538
00:46:04,108 --> 00:46:06,977
You came to Vienna believing
you won two tickets to the opera.

539
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:09,483
I attempted to recruit you into
assassinating the Chancellor.

540
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:11,116
- You refused.
- That's not the truth!

541
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:13,634
Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji.

542
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:15,974
It'll go easier if you tell
them what they want to hear.

543
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:19,146
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

544
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,451
You recognize anyone?

545
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:43,304
Him.

546
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:45,679
He's former KSA. German intelligence.

547
00:46:45,714 --> 00:46:47,380
Missing, presumed dead.

548
00:46:48,243 --> 00:46:49,946
He was at the opera tonight.

549
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:51,240
This one, too.

550
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,443
Former Mossad.

551
00:46:53,475 --> 00:46:55,378
Let me guess. Presumed dead.

552
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,281
Tonight, I made it official.

553
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,153
I was looking for him in the Bosphorus.

554
00:47:01,188 --> 00:47:04,659
The same day, a car accident killed
the visiting President of Malawi.

555
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:07,867
He slipped away again in Jakarta,

556
00:47:08,665 --> 00:47:11,854
hours before a passenger
plane vanished over the Pacific

557
00:47:11,889 --> 00:47:14,024
with 236 passengers.

558
00:47:15,071 --> 00:47:17,006
I just missed him in the Philippines

559
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,369
right before a fire at
a petrochemical plant

560
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:21,641
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

561
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:26,784
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

562
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:29,347
That missing plane was carrying

563
00:47:29,382 --> 00:47:31,609
the Secretary of the World Bank.

564
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:36,283
That fire bankrupted a
global arms corporation.

565
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:39,693
That wreck triggered a civil war.

566
00:47:41,503 --> 00:47:43,317
These are no accidents.

567
00:47:43,879 --> 00:47:45,314
They're links in a chain.

568
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:48,948
The work of a single
organization, the Syndicate.

569
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,761
A rogue nation, trained to do what we do,

570
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:53,669
imbued with a new sense of purpose.

571
00:47:53,702 --> 00:47:56,136
Destroy the system that created them

572
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:58,316
regardless of who's in their way.

573
00:47:59,186 --> 00:48:01,585
An anti-IMF.

574
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,267
Since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

575
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:07,850
Killing the Chancellor
tonight was a statement,

576
00:48:07,883 --> 00:48:10,162
the start of a new phase.

577
00:48:10,197 --> 00:48:14,010
Or they could just be a
series of random disasters.

578
00:48:15,357 --> 00:48:16,819
He was there.

579
00:48:17,693 --> 00:48:19,107
Every time.

580
00:48:19,142 --> 00:48:21,827
Just like he was there
tonight, I'm sure of it.

581
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:25,104
I don't know who he is, where he's from,

582
00:48:26,102 --> 00:48:27,970
how he's funded.

583
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:30,188
But I know he's the key.

584
00:48:30,223 --> 00:48:33,934
Ethan, this is what I signed up
for. Let me help you find him.

585
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:35,893
That's why I brought you
here in the first place,

586
00:48:35,928 --> 00:48:37,413
and look what happened!

587
00:48:37,446 --> 00:48:39,182
I can't protect you.

588
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,356
That's why I need you to leave.

589
00:48:41,391 --> 00:48:44,133
That's not your decision to make, Ethan!

590
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,334
I am a field agent. I know the risks.

591
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:49,104
More than that, I am your friend,

592
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:50,982
no matter what I tell
the polygraph every week.

593
00:48:51,017 --> 00:48:54,116
Now, you called me
because you needed my help.

594
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:57,092
And you still do. So I am staying.

595
00:48:57,399 --> 00:48:59,336
And that is all we are
going to say about that.

596
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:04,981
Okay.

597
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:06,869
Good.

598
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:10,219
Where do we start?

599
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:13,441
Ilsa.

600
00:49:16,017 --> 00:49:18,656
Right. And how do we find her?

601
00:49:18,691 --> 00:49:20,860
She said we have everything we need.

00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:06,412
You send me to do a job, I
do it. But my way, not yours.

606
00:50:06,447 --> 00:50:07,747
Where did I deviate?

607
00:50:07,782 --> 00:50:09,896
You put two more gunmen
at the opera tonight.

608
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:11,522
One of them tried to kill me.

609
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:12,641
You missed.

610
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,334
I missed because Ethan Hunt
was there looking for you.

611
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:18,822
Ethan Hunt's in Vienna because you
allowed him to escape in London.

612
00:50:18,857 --> 00:50:20,310
Vinter would have killed him in London,

613
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:22,604
and that's not what you asked for.

614
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:25,462
Twice now you've let him slip away.

615
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:28,554
Curious.

616
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:31,402
Are you questioning my
loyalty or my ability?

Can't decide.

618
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:37,397
I've told you before, trust me or kill me.

619
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:39,954
But if you're going to kill me, be a man.

620
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:42,986

He knows about Morocco.

624
00:51:16,985 --> 00:51:19,411
What does he know about Morocco?

625
00:51:19,446 --> 00:51:23,332
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

All I know about you is that
you chose to work for Hunley.

00:54:21,118 --> 00:54:24,275
Yeah. All I know about
you is you chose to resign.

00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:20,560
He created the Syndicate.

Where does he come from?

673
00:55:23,272 --> 00:55:25,596
He's former British intelligence.

674
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:28,835
Well, if British intelligence
knows the Syndicate exists,

675
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,971
why don't they just tell the CIA?

676
00:55:31,093 --> 00:55:32,677
Because they don't want anyone knowing

677
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:35,918
the Syndicate was created
by one of their own.

678
00:55:36,551 --> 00:55:39,521
I was sent undercover to earn Lane's trust

679
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,831
and eventually identify the
members of his organization.

680
00:55:42,912 --> 00:55:44,983
And for the first time in two years,

681
00:55:45,186 --> 00:55:47,460
I'm close to knowing who they are.

682
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,389
Lane had a ledger.

683
00:55:49,464 --> 00:55:53,628
It contained the identities of his
operatives, his terrorist associates,

684
00:55:53,716 --> 00:55:56,497
the entire inner workings of the Syndicate.

685
00:55:56,532 --> 00:55:59,623
One of his agents stole
it, hoping to blackmail him,

686
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:03,760
and kept it in a secure computer
facility for safekeeping.

687
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:06,528
He died being interrogated
for the access code,

688
00:56:06,562 --> 00:56:09,041
leaving Lane with a serious problem.

689
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:13,043
So the key to crushing Lane

690
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:16,645
is sitting in a computer, just
waiting for someone to take it.

691
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:20,646
So, why hasn't Lane just
sent someone to steal it?

692
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,888
Oh, he has.

693
00:56:23,244 --> 00:56:25,381
He sent me.

694
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:27,430
And I can tell you

695
00:56:28,497 --> 00:56:30,156
it's impossible.

696
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:37,781
The facility's hidden beneath a local
power plant under military guard.

697
00:56:37,816 --> 00:56:39,568
And the only way to download the ledger

698
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:42,635
is through the central computer
terminal, located there.

699
00:56:43,865 --> 00:56:47,030
<i>To reach the terminal, you'll
need to pass the main gate,</i>

<i>access the elevator with
fingerprint recognition,</i>

701
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:54,766
<i>and open three separate
combination locks.</i>

00:57:00,395 --> 00:57:02,042
BENJI: <i>Well, that's easy. We
just impersonate the agent</i>

703
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:05,626

place, and I get to wear a mask!

Why would Lane want it so

Why would he ever let
you have it if it was?

Did you never stop to consider
that he may want me to have it?

Misinformation, manipulation,
it's what he does, Ilsa.

940
01:22:25,839 --> 01:22:27,533
It's what he's trained to do.

941
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:30,739
Lane lies to you, you
sell these lies to Hunt.

942
01:22:30,774 --> 01:22:34,504
Together, you're both compromised.
That's his ultimate objective.

943

This may be authentic.

944
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,235
But there's only one person I trust

945
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:41,303
to verify that information. You.

946
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:44,591
No.

My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

948

Your orders were to
infiltrate the Syndicate

949

about them firsthand.

The only way to pass is to go back.

952
01:22:59,406 --> 01:23:03,444
I can't do that. I've betrayed
Lane's trust too many times.

953
01:23:03,476 --> 01:23:05,953
And in every instance, you
did so on your own volition.

954
01:23:05,988 --> 01:23:08,701
He was going to torture
and kill an American agent.

955
01:23:08,736 --> 01:23:12,120
And you should have let him. Then
you would still have Lane's trust.

956
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,321
This is the trade. Hunt understands that.

957
01:23:14,355 --> 01:23:16,909
I wasn't going to let
him die. He's our ally.

There are no allies in statecraft,

is a man without a country.

Good God, no. Nothing so crude as that. No.

963
01:23:36,582 --> 01:23:38,576
Lane will order you.

And to regain his trust,

965
01:23:41,896 --> 01:23:43,331
you will do it.

Yes, him.

993

So what you're saying
is there is no ledger,

994
01:25:07,837 --> 01:25:10,258
which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exists.

So we're back to square one, only
now we are all wanted by the CIA.

is why is there a red box

998

sat in a private data vault in Morocco?

999
01:25:21,986 --> 01:25:24,243
And why would Lane want
it if he can't open it?

1000

If Lane wants it, you can
bet he has a plan to open it.

1001
01:25:28,862 --> 01:25:31,058
And we just helped him steal it.

1002
01:25:34,455 --> 01:25:36,581
He's going to take the Prime Minister.

1003
01:25:36,616 --> 01:25:39,801
Yes, he is. The question is how.

No, Brandt. Put down the phone.

Let's think about this for a minute.

We have a responsibility to
warn the British government

1009
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:50,843
and not gamble with the
Prime Minister's life, Ethan,

Brandt?

1013
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:05,871
Is that what you think this is?

1014
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:08,148
I think right now

1015
01:26:08,183 --> 01:26:10,324
you're incapable of seeing
that there is another way.

1016

capable of seeing the only way.

1018

And if he is wrong, then we
have Vienna all over again!

there is no preventing it!

That's why we have to warn the British.

1022
01:26:23,735 --> 01:26:26,032
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

We are going to warn the British.

1027
01:26:39,786 --> 01:26:42,427
All right, Ethan. We're going to find Lane.

are we going to do that?

the file was encrypted.

And why would I lie to you?

1035
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,674
So that I would lie to Hunt.

1036
01:27:40,074 --> 01:27:43,172
But he wouldn't have stolen
it if he knew what it was.

you start being honest with me.

01:28:44,804 --> 01:28:49,076
Ethan Hunt is a gambler. And
one day his luck will run out,

1055
01:28:49,162 --> 01:28:52,660
and thousands of innocent
people will pay the price.

1056
01:28:52,965 --> 01:28:55,550
Which one of us will be the villain then?

1057
01:28:59,031 --> 01:29:01,745
Nothing here. It's empty.

1060

1061
01:30:12,193 --> 01:30:13,537
So that's her?

1062

That's her.

1063
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:23,444
I have to say you sure can ride.

1064
01:30:25,946 --> 01:30:28,402

- You were just doing your job.

That's all we're going to say about it.

Atlee said you would understand.

1067
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:38,440
Atlee. Your handler in
British intelligence.

1068
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:43,371
And he didn't bring you in,

1069
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:47,734
even after you gave him the disk.

1070
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:50,952
You knew perfectly well it was blank.

1072

The disk she took from me was
an exact copy. I'm sure of it.

1073
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,723
Was it in your possession the entire time?

01:31:22,829 --> 01:31:26,652
I hoped you would. I hoped
it'd be enough to get you out.

1078
01:31:27,414 --> 01:31:30,502
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That means Lane
doesn't have the disk. Only we do.

1079
01:31:30,537 --> 01:31:31,652
I have a question.

1080
01:31:31,685 --> 01:31:35,728
If the disk was blank,
why is she still alive?

1081
01:31:35,763 --> 01:31:39,825
<i>Unless, of course, Lane
wanted us to find her.</i>

1082
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:43,367
So who you working for now?

1083
01:31:44,183 --> 01:31:48,291
Lane, Atlee, your government, my
government, they're all the same.

1084
01:31:48,442 --> 01:31:49,996
We only think we're
fighting for the right side

1085
01:31:50,031 --> 01:31:52,589
because that's what we choose to believe.

1086
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:55,676
So where does that leave us?

1087
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:58,539
The way I see it, you have three choices.

1088
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:02,166
One, you hand me and
the disk over to the CIA.

1089
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:04,174
I am proof the Syndicate exists.

1090
01:32:04,209 --> 01:32:07,658
Lane becomes their problem
and your work is done.

1091
01:32:07,693 --> 01:32:08,914
My thoughts exactly.

1092
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:10,271
Works for me.

1093
01:32:10,306 --> 01:32:12,245
But you know they're not gonna believe you.

1094
01:32:12,353 --> 01:32:14,638
And you'll all be tried for treason.

1095
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:16,652
Lane goes free.

1096
01:32:16,687 --> 01:32:18,522
I'm afraid she has a point.

1097
01:32:18,557 --> 01:32:22,387
Two, you let me walk
away to an uncertain fate.

1098
01:32:22,849 --> 01:32:25,906
You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.

1099
01:32:26,586 --> 01:32:29,506
But some part of you suspects
you've met your match.

1100
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,161
And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk,

1101
01:32:32,222 --> 01:32:34,515
whether you want to or not.

1102
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:36,712
That is entirely possible.

1103
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:38,647
And option three?

1104
01:32:39,064 --> 01:32:40,880
Come away with me.

1105
01:32:42,001 --> 01:32:43,283

1108
01:32:53,845 --> 01:32:55,720
Forget about Lane.

1225
01:41:25,241 --> 01:41:27,290
that can only be opened by you.

1226
01:41:27,325 --> 01:41:30,818
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

1227
01:41:32,418 --> 01:41:34,404
The Syndicate, you say?

1228
01:41:34,439 --> 01:41:37,087
BRANDT: Yes, sir. That's what he calls it.

1229
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:39,410
Atlee?

1230
01:41:39,878 --> 01:41:42,047
He couldn't possibly be talking about

1231
01:41:42,682 --> 01:41:44,465
that Syndicate.

1232
01:41:46,665 --> 01:41:50,602
Because you assured me that that
Syndicate was merely an exercise.

1233
01:41:50,735 --> 01:41:54,125
And it was, Prime
Minister, I can assure you.

1234
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:54,720
And yet here we have

1235
01:41:54,755 --> 01:41:57,362
the Central Intelligence
Agency indicating otherwise.

1236
01:41:57,397 --> 01:41:58,799
I don't understand.

1237
01:41:58,834 --> 01:42:01,108
Prime Minister, your life is in danger.

1238
01:42:01,143 --> 01:42:03,491
I think our first priority is
to move you to a secure location.

1239
01:42:03,526 --> 01:42:08,063
Sir, does the name
Solomon Lane ring a bell?

1240
01:42:09,647 --> 01:42:10,716
Yes.

1241
01:42:11,557 --> 01:42:15,556
Unfortunately, it does.

1242
01:42:17,431 --> 01:42:20,467
So there actually is a Syndicate?

1243
01:42:20,499 --> 01:42:24,675
It was the hypothetical
brainchild of Chief Atlee.

1244
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:27,463
Recruit former agents from other nations,

1245
01:42:27,498 --> 01:42:29,019
supply them with a new identity,

1246
01:42:29,054 --> 01:42:31,178
and use them to surgically
remove our enemies,

1247
01:42:31,237 --> 01:42:33,561
both at home and abroad.

1248
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:35,957
Its operating budget
was to be hidden offshore

1249
01:42:35,992 --> 01:42:39,553
in a virtual red box which
I alone would control.

1250
01:42:39,588 --> 01:42:42,121
It would have made me
judge, jury, and executioner,

1251
01:42:42,192 --> 01:42:43,522
with zero accountability.

1252
01:42:43,637 --> 01:42:46,359
I rejected the proposal, unequivocally.

1253
01:42:46,392 --> 01:42:48,962
Furthermore, I was given every assurance

1254
01:42:48,997 --> 01:42:50,954
it never passed the planning stage.

1255
01:42:50,989 --> 01:42:53,852
Prime Minister, there is no Syndicate.

1256
01:42:53,887 --> 01:42:56,222
These men have been duped by Agent Faust.

1257
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:59,947
Atlee! Save it for the public inquiry.

1258
01:42:59,982 --> 01:43:01,406
Sir, I urge you not to leave this room.

1259
01:43:01,441 --> 01:43:03,251
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1260
01:43:03,286 --> 01:43:05,812
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

1261
01:43:05,845 --> 01:43:09,164
A specialist without equal,
immune to any countermeasures.

1262
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:11,594
There is no secret he cannot extract.

1263
01:43:11,657 --> 01:43:15,637
No security he cannot breach.
No person he cannot become.

1264
01:43:15,756 --> 01:43:19,431
He has, most likely, anticipated
this very conversation

1265
01:43:19,479 --> 01:43:22,354
and is waiting to strike in
whatever direction we move.

1266
01:43:22,481 --> 01:43:26,485
Sir, Hunt is the living
manifestation of destiny.

1267
01:43:26,565 --> 01:43:30,054
And he has made you his mission.

1268
01:43:30,664 --> 01:43:31,966
ATLEE: Prime Minister?

1269

(SOFT GROAN)

1270
01:43:48,586 --> 01:43:50,107
Hunt.

1271
01:43:50,188 --> 01:43:52,543
Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister.

1272
01:43:56,462 --> 01:43:58,531
Just relax, sir. Everything's
going to be all right.

1273
01:43:58,604 --> 01:44:00,064
Atlee shot me.

1274
01:44:00,152 --> 01:44:01,733
Yes, he did, sir.

1275
01:44:04,984 --> 01:44:07,453
Hunt, I hope you realize you've set back

American Revolution?

1277
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:13,965
Desperate times, desperate measures, sir.

1279
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:17,044
I'm here.

01:44:17,079 --> 01:44:19,389
- ETHAN: <i>Stand by to receive.</i>
- Ready.

1281
01:44:25,532 --> 01:44:28,093
The Prime Minister's office
asked me to meet him here.

1282
01:44:28,172 --> 01:44:29,496
This way, sir.

01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:39,665
Mmm.

1286
01:44:39,791 --> 01:44:41,660
It's okay. Here you go, sir.

1287
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:45,511
You've got a very warm hand.

1288

1289
01:44:56,755 --> 01:44:58,289
The prompt is "Kipling."

1290
01:44:58,324 --> 01:45:00,922
The prompt is "Kipling."

1291
01:45:00,957 --> 01:45:04,976
Sir, I'm going to need a
pass-phrase. The prompt is "Kipling."

1292
01:45:05,051 --> 01:45:06,617
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, of course.

1293

Oh, man, do I got it.

I'm here to see the Prime Minister.

1299
01:45:29,068 --> 01:45:31,021
We were told not to let anybody in.

1300
01:45:31,184 --> 01:45:32,525
By whom?

1301
01:45:32,679 --> 01:45:34,095
By you, sir.

1302
01:45:37,691 --> 01:45:39,964
ATLEE: Hunley? What is this?

1303
01:45:40,071 --> 01:45:41,506
Security!

1304
01:45:46,552 --> 01:45:47,954
(BODIES THUDDING)

1305
01:45:48,174 --> 01:45:49,642
ETHAN: Chief Atlee.

1306
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:51,768
Kind of you to accept our invitation.

1307
01:45:52,141 --> 01:45:53,077
Ah.

1308
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:03,730
Do you know who I am?

1309
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:07,587
We know you created the Syndicate.

1310
01:46:07,642 --> 01:46:10,462
But Lane went rogue and turned
it against you, didn't he?

1311
01:46:10,537 --> 01:46:12,966
And you've been desperately
trying to cover it up.

1312
01:46:12,998 --> 01:46:15,667
That's why you erased the disk
when she brought it to you.

1313
01:46:15,781 --> 01:46:17,872
That's true.

1314
01:46:20,293 --> 01:46:24,776
Now, Director Hunley has some
questions for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

1315
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:27,379
Namely, how you framed her.

1316
01:46:27,466 --> 01:46:30,956
That's also true.

1317
01:46:34,645 --> 01:46:36,210
It's the antidote.

1318
01:46:36,245 --> 01:46:38,691
When the Prime Minister
found out about the Syndicate,

1319
01:46:38,879 --> 01:46:40,293
Atlee attacked him.

1320
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,760
Yes, that's true.

1321
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:44,397
And then you saved the Prime Minister, sir.

1322
01:46:44,529 --> 01:46:45,697
PRIME MINISTER: Did he?

1323
01:46:46,431 --> 01:46:48,092
I'm very grateful.

minutes, he'll kill Benji.

Either way, you killed
too many innocent people

giving the orders or why.

<i>You blame the system for what
you are, instead of yourself.</i>

You wanted revenge, but Rome
wasn't destroyed in a day.

I am the disk.

I memorized it. All £2.4
billion in numbered accounts.

memorize the entire disk.</i>

There's only one way to be sure.

1396
01:52:45,957 --> 01:52:47,476

you were going to take things too far?

Director Hunley!

Uh, Mr. Chairman.

1455
02:03:23,506 --> 02:03:25,422
CHAIRMAN: Six months ago,
you stood before this panel

1456
02:03:25,457 --> 02:03:28,192
and demanded that the IMF be dissolved.

1457
02:03:28,325 --> 02:03:30,072
HUNLEY: That is correct, sir.

1458
02:03:30,107 --> 02:03:32,023
How do you explain your testimony today?

1459
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:34,484
It's quite simple, really.
We had reason to believe that

1460
02:03:34,519 --> 02:03:37,923
the Syndicate had infiltrated our
government at the highest level.

1461
02:03:37,958 --> 02:03:40,360
In order for our man to
infiltrate that organization,

1462
02:03:40,456 --> 02:03:43,346
his cover had to be absolute.

1463
02:03:43,381 --> 02:03:44,587
The whole operation was known

1464
02:03:44,622 --> 02:03:47,948
only to myself and a handful of IMF agents.

1465
02:03:47,983 --> 02:03:52,754
So the shuttering of the IMF was
all part of an elaborate scheme

1466
02:03:52,956 --> 02:03:55,127
to expose the so-called Syndicate.

1467
02:03:55,162 --> 02:03:56,458
That is correct, sir.

1468
02:03:56,493 --> 02:04:01,865
Which is why you're here today
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

1469
02:04:01,926 --> 02:04:03,362
That is correct, sir.

1470
02:04:06,057 --> 02:04:07,240
I'm not sure the Committee approves

1471
02:04:07,275 --> 02:04:09,577
of your methods, Director Hunley.

1472
02:04:09,612 --> 02:04:13,614
Uh, desperate times, desperate
measures, Mr. Chairman.

1473
02:04:14,845 --> 02:04:19,371
And you, Mr. Brandt, how can
you justify this deception?

deny details of any operation
